# 21.gifts visual design system

## How to use this document

This file is the **current inventory** of the shipped 21.gifts web UI plus the **binding** grammar for new work.

- New or migrated surfaces compose the parts named here. Do not invent a second look.
- Reviewers follow the control-grammar table here and in `CONTRIBUTING.md` **Icon controls**.
- Product behaviour, variants, and goldens live in `docs/handbook/screens.md` and `e2e/visual.spec.ts`. This file owns visual language.
- Brand copy source: the API concept document, section Brand. Visual source: live marketing at `/` plus the recipes in Screen recipes.
- Markdown in this public repo is the source of truth. Figma is not.
- Never name private repositories, internal hostnames, or infra internals.

## Principles

Closed set. Each principle is one sentence plus one implication in this codebase.

1. **One family.** The product is a single geometric grotesque, not a marketing face plus a system-ui app. _Implication:_ Outfit loads via `next/font/google` in `src/app/layout.tsx`; `body` uses `font-sans`; do not leave app pages on the Tailwind default stack.

2. **Two shells, one origin.** Marketing is always ink; app is themeable paper/ink. _Implication:_ routes under `src/app/(marketing)/` (and `/404` / `not-found.tsx`) use `bg-ink text-paper` with no `ThemeSwitcher`. All other pages use `app-*` tokens only.

3. **Orange is shell-split.** On the **marketing shell**, `#f7931a` is the primary filled CTA (header **Log in**, **Ask for help**) plus kickers. On the **app shell**, it is gift-money fill only (charts, ₿ selected, donate **Open the forum**). _Implication:_ do not call marketing **Log in** a gift. App form primaries (`Button variant="primary"`) stay `bg-app-btn`. `Button variant="accent"` is the orange fill; marketing uses it as shell primary, the app uses it for gift-intent only.

4. **Tech is invisible.** Visitors are never asked about keys, relays, NOSTR, invoices, or sats-as-jargon. _Implication:_ UI says “Bitcoin”, “your 21.gifts wallet”, “address”, `formatBitcoin` (`₿1'500`; visitor may pick US `10,000.23` / German `23.000,33`). No `npub`, no “zap”, no “Lightning”, no “Spark”, no “LNURL” on any screen except the external-author profile page at /messages/[id]/author, which shows a published Nostr address when it matches the key, a payment address only as published text when it differs, and the npub to copy.

5. **People first.** Receiver names and notes are the hero; chrome is quiet. _Implication:_ forum note body is `text-sm text-app-fg`; chrome labels are `text-app-muted`. On the signed-in profile, a stored wide image and a round photo sit above the title. The About me photo stays with that note. A missing wide image or profile photo is a labeled button that adds that picture (`Add a wide image`, `Add a profile photo`).

6. **Wordmark is chrome, not a logo file.** The brand is the text `21.gifts`. _Implication:_ `Wordmark` in both shells; do not draw a mark unless it is the existing favicon “21” on ink. The one exception is the printed shop-sticker artwork (see **Brand**).

7. **Primitives, not class soup.** New or migrated surfaces compose catalog parts. _Implication:_ reject raw `rounded-full bg-app-btn px-6 py-3` and raw `bg-neutral-900` outside `src/components/ui/`.

8. **Do not canonize defects.** Goldens document current pixels; this file is the system. _Implication:_ do not reintroduce double ₿, an empty-chart axis, orange **text** on paper, an invoice QR on a member pay sheet, a public pay-link invoice QR on smartphone UA, a named third-party wallet, or hard-coded Inter/gray SaaS.

9. **Staff action stacks stay closed.** A stack of labeled moderator or founder actions on a member card is not painted as loose buttons. _Implication:_ one closed disclosure, catalog `staff.functions` ("Moderator functions" / "Moderatorenfunktionen"), a closed `details` / `summary` row, not a full-width button. Opening it reveals only the actions that viewer may use on that person. The opened disclosure is its own screenshot state, not only the closed summary. Founder-only actions such as appoint use the same disclosure. Delete on a note stays the icon in the footer icon row. Routes under `/moderate` are the opened workspace and do not add a second disclosure around their own tools. The Menu row **Moderation** stays. The staff inbox origin filter stays. Role pills are identity, not actions.

10. **Amount fields carry the unit switch.** Every typed amount uses the gift ₿ / fiat-code control, and the other unit sits under the field. The last choice is stored on the account and is the default everywhere. A signed-out pay link still shows the switch and starts at ₿. What is sent is always whole sats. _Implication:_ a new amount field without the switch or the counter is an undeclared deviation. The daily payout roster on `/grants/payments/amounts` is the stored USD figure spend pays, so those inputs stay `Field` and the body stays `amountUsd`. Fiat mode is its own screenshot state. The input box, its placeholder, and the start of the digits do not change when the unit changes; the switch and the counter do.

11. **A press that changes the screen has its own baseline.** The picture before the press does not count. _Implication:_ an icon-only status mark whose press reveals or hides its meaning is that kind of control. The same PR adds the handbook variant, the e2e needle, the `shotScreen` call, and a Playwright Linux baseline for every combo. The resting shot alone is rejected.

12. **One back, the previous view.** Every screen in the app has exactly one back control, the top-left arrow beside the wordmark, including marketing, login, donate, the pay link, the public profile, setup, unsigned notes, and 404. _Implication:_ a second back arrow, link, or button anywhere else — card, footer, wizard, sheet, or any other region — is absolutely forbidden. The arrow returns to the in-app view this tab showed immediately before the current one. It does not jump to a fixed parent and it does not leave the site. It opens that view with the client-side router, never with a document load. If this tab has no earlier in-app view, the arrow opens `/welcome`. `/welcome`, the forum home, never shows the arrow, whatever this tab's view stack holds. The Menu's **Home** clears that stack, so the next screen's arrow returns to `/welcome`. The wordmark is not that control. A dismiss that stays on the view is Close (`X`), not Back. A handbook lightbox previous-image control is not a back control.

13. **Signed in means the wallet is open.** A member counts as signed in only while the wallet recovery phrase is in this tab's memory, except for an account that cannot hold a wallet. _Implication:_ after reload, in a new tab, or after reopening the app, the central `OnboardingGate` holds the stored session back and shows the ordinary login card in place of every signed-in screen on the same path; **Log in** refreshes the session and opens the wallet with one passkey prompt, asking for the seed passkey only when another passkey signed in. Guest-allowed `/welcome`, `/statistics`, and `/habit-tracker` show that card too: a held-back session is a member, never a guest. One-time wallet setup runs later in the background and never delays onboarding or a non-money screen. While it shows, the signed-in Menu is absent. For a held-back session the card greets the member (**Welcome back, {name}**), keeps **Open a new account**, and has no **Log out**: whichever passkey logs in decides the account. `/login` sends a fresh login on only once its wallet is open, so a failure keeps its alert on the card there.

## Brand

**Wordmark.** The string `21.gifts` in Outfit, weight 700, tracking `0`. Not an SVG logotype. The drawn assets are the favicon/app-icon “21” and, only inside the printed shop sticker (`src/lib/shop-sticker-artwork.ts`, see **Overlay** › Shop sticker), the outlined Outfit 700 `21.gifts` shop sign with an orange **21** — a print product, never app chrome.

| Context                | Size             | Weight | Color               | Element                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Marketing header       | 17px / 1.06rem   | 700    | `paper` (`#ffffff`) | `ProfileChromeLeft tone="dark"` plus `HomeWordmark tone="dark"` (`/` unsigned, `/welcome` when a session is hydrated)                                              |
| Marketing footer       | 15px / 0.9375rem | 700    | `paper`             | `Wordmark tone="dark" size="footer"` as `<span>`                                                                                                                   |
| App chrome (unsigned)  | 17px / 1.06rem   | 700    | `app-fg`            | `ProfileChromeLeft` plus `HomeWordmark` on `/login`, `/donate`, `/pl`, `/view/*`; wordmark `/` on unsigned `/rules`, `/messages/[id]`, and `/messages/[id]/author` |
| App chrome (signed-in) | 17px / 1.06rem   | 700    | `app-fg`            | `Wordmark` link `/welcome`, except `/setup/*` (`<span>` — `OnboardingGate` would bounce an incomplete account off `/welcome`)                                      |

**Clear space.** Minimum 8px (`spacing-2`) on all sides of the glyph bounds. Do not place controls closer than 12px (`spacing-3`) to the wordmark.

**Do not.** Orange wordmark, outline wordmark, stacked “21” over “gifts”, a gift-box logo next to the wordmark in chrome. The combined gift-and-Bitcoin SVG on `/welcome` is a **page glyph**, not the brand mark.

**Favicon / apple-touch / OG (keep).**

- `public/favicon.svg` — 64×64, fill `#0A090C`, text `21` at 32px/700, fill `#f7931a`. This is the only drawn mark in the app; the shop sticker's outlined sign is print artwork (see **Wordmark**).
- `public/favicon.ico` — 48×48, same composition.
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` / `icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png` — ink field, orange `21`, no rounded-squircle decoration beyond what iOS applies.
- `public/og.png` — ink, orange kicker `PEER-TO-PEER · BITCOIN`, white `21.gifts`, subtitle, orange-outline pill. Keep.

## Color

Live tokens from `src/app/globals.css` `@theme` and `html.dark`.

**Sacred hexes (do not shift).**

| Name   | Hex       | Role                                                     |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ink    | `#0a090c` | Marketing canvas; app dark `app-bg`                      |
| Paper  | `#ffffff` | App light canvas; marketing type                         |
| Accent | `#f7931a` | Bitcoin orange — marketing primary + app gift-money fill |
| Given  | `#525252` | Profile “Given” series (neutral; not accent)             |

**Shell-stable tokens** (do not flip with `html.dark`; marketing uses these):

| Token    | Hex       | Tailwind                   |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| `ink`    | `#0a090c` | `bg-ink`, `text-ink`       |

**Orange rule (closed, two shells).** Live marketing uses orange as the **dark-shell primary**. Pay-link **Pay** (`forum.payOpenWallet`, aria `forum.payOpenWalletAria` “Pay with a Bitcoin wallet app”) and the pay slot's **Send** are `bg-app-btn` (labeled sentence-length, not accent). App **Log in** stays `app-btn`.

**(A) Marketing shell** (`bg-ink`): orange is the primary filled CTA plus kickers.

This is not “Log in is a gift.” Ink pages have one filled accent, and it is Bitcoin orange.

**(B) App shell** (`app-*`): orange is **gift-money** only — fills and chart paint, never body/kicker **text** on paper (~2.3:1).

**QR plates.** Always `bg-app-qr-bg` (`#ffffff`) + `border-app-border`. Dark theme does **not** invert the QR. Module color `app-qr-fg` (`#000000`). Quiet zone: `p-4` on a 232px module grid (`QR_SIZE = 232`). QR is shown on a smartphone. A specific invoice is different: member pay sheets (forum gifts and replies, posting fees, inbox) never show an invoice QR on any device, and the public pay link omits its invoice QR on a smartphone (`isSmartphoneUserAgent`, not viewport), the same card as desktop, without a mounted `QrCode`. The QR revealed by **Top up your wallet** on `/loans/repay` is the member's own address QR, so it follows the profile rule and remains visible on phones.

## Typography

**Family (one).** [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit), SIL Open Font License 1.1. Geometric grotesque. Outfit on Google Fonts is a **variable** face (`wght` 100–900).

`next/font/google` treats a **weight array as the non-variable API**. An array can fail `next build`. Use the variable range string.

```tsx
// src/app/layout.tsx
import { Outfit } from 'next/font/google';

const outfit = Outfit({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: 'variable',
  display: 'block', // avoid FOUT in visual goldens; swap is allowed only with fonts.ready in shotScreen
  variable: '--font-outfit',
});

export default async function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }): Promise<ReactElement> {
  const locale = await getRequestLocale();
  return (
    <html lang={locale} suppressHydrationWarning className={outfit.variable}>
      …
      <body className="font-sans bg-app-bg text-app-fg antialiased">
```

`className={outfit.variable}` **must** sit on `<html>` so `--font-outfit` exists. Without it, `@theme` interpolation is a no-op and pages stay on system-ui.

```css
@theme {
  --font-sans: var(--font-outfit), ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

`next/font/google` downloads at **`next build`**, then self-hosts at runtime. CI and the image-build stage must reach `fonts.google.com` (or the Next font endpoint). If that is blocked, vendor the files and switch to `next/font/local`. Do not fetch Google Fonts from the browser at runtime.

If anyone uses `display: 'swap'`, `shotScreen` **must** `await page.evaluate(() => document.fonts.ready)` before `toHaveScreenshot`, or Linux goldens flake on FOUT.

**Forbidden as the brand face:** Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system-ui. `system-ui` / `ui-sans-serif` are **fallback only**. Do not add a display serif. Do not add IBM Plex / Geist / another second family.

**Ramp.** 16px root. Use these classes (write the utilities on the JSX as CONTRIBUTING requires).

**One title per page.** The document outline has one `h1` (or `card-title` used as the sole heading). Card must not repeat a page title. `LoginPage` has no outer “Log in to 21.gifts”; the only heading is `LoginCard` at **card-title** (`login.heading`, or `login.choiceHeading` on the account-choice state). Do not add the outer title back. Welcome has no Forum heading; the only `h1` is “Welcome, {name}”.

**`formatBitcoin`.** `src/lib/stats-money.ts`: leading U+20BF `₿`, style-grouped via `NumberFormatStyle`, no space, no fraction. Default Swiss `₿1'500`. JSON stays `sats` / `totalSats`. Render in a `span` with `tabular-nums lining-nums`. Do not replace U+20BF with lucide `Bitcoin`. Do not put a second ₿ beside the string.

Fiat: `formatFiatDisplay` → `$1.43` / `CHF 1'425.00` / `EUR 1.30` / `₱80.00` (null → em dash; Swiss grouping default). USD wrapper `formatUsdDisplay` still used for the stats KPI when USD is selected. Axis ticks: stats and profile fiat ticks use `formatFiatTick` (USD selected may still call `formatUsdTick` as a wrapper; `$0`, `$1.43`, `$1'425`). Visitor styles `us` / `de` change grouping, not the currency. Toggle anatomy in §10.

**Link type.** Marketing inline links: `text-accent underline underline-offset-2`. App inline links (rules, contact): `text-app-fg underline underline-offset-2 font-medium`. Do not make app body links orange (fails on paper; also not a gift CTA).

## Space, radius, elevation, motion

**Spacing scale** (4px base = Tailwind default). Use only these on new surfaces:

App page padding is `px-3 py-2` on `<main>` (12px), `px-2` below 360px, with the frame rows (chrome, header slot, menu sheet host, page column, footer) at `px-5` (20px; chrome `px-3` below 360px), so the signed-in header fits at 320px. Marketing content padding is `px-5` (20px). Do not mix.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```

This global `*` hammer is WCAG 2.3.3-compliant and **does freeze** `Loader2` and the 1200ms copy-check flash (they become static). That is acceptable. The forum reveals a focused field by writing the one scrollport's `scrollTop` (`revealInScrollport`), not `scrollIntoView`, and that does **not** depend on this CSS. Do not introduce `behavior: 'smooth'` without a reduced-motion guard.

**Hit targets.** WCAG 2.2 AA 2.5.8 is **24×24px**. 44×44 is 2.5.5 AAA.

| Size           | Layout / paint              | Hit target           | Glyph |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| `sm`           | `h-6 w-6` + `::before` slop | 44×44 via `::before` | 16px  |
| `md` (default) | `h-11 w-11` (44px painted)  | 44×44                | 20px  |
| `lg`           | `h-12 w-12` (48px painted)  | 48×48                | 20px  |

`sm` class (`::before` without `content` does not generate a box):

```
relative isolate inline-flex h-6 w-6 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full leading-none
before:absolute before:content-[''] before:block before:-inset-2.5 before:min-h-11 before:min-w-11 before:rounded-full
```

The painted control stays `h-6 w-6`. The lucide node sits in `relative z-10`. Do **not** paint `sm` as `h-11`.

**Clustered `sm` must not overlap.** `-inset-2.5` is 10px slop per side → 44px hit. Any row of two or more `sm` IconButtons uses `gap-5` (20px): 24px paint + 20px gap = 44px center-to-center, hits **touch, do not overlap**. Isolated `sm` (laws dismiss, pay-sheet close) sit in an absolute wrapper (see **Card close (X)** under `IconButton`).

## One scroll surface

A page scrolls in exactly one place. `html` and `body` are locked to `--app-height` (`overflow: clip`). The only scroller is the innermost bound `[data-scrollport]` (`Scrollport` inside `AppShell`, the marketing shell, the 404 page, or a dialog that locks the page behind it). Among siblings, that is the most recently bound one. It has `data-scroll-active`. Every other port has `data-scroll-locked` and stays clipped; absence of the lock is not permission to scroll. `ScrollSurfaceGuard` clips any other `auto`, `scroll`, or `overlay` overflow, including one added later from script. Textareas grow with their text. Inputs and selects stay native. Do not add `overflow-auto`, `overflow-scroll`, or an inline scrolling overflow. `scripts/check-scrollports.mjs` fails lint when that shows up, including a second scrolling overflow in `globals.css`, and it checks its own detector on every run.

A box stays inside the window. Only a slide inside `[data-scroll-x]` may extend past the left or
right edge, and that row's own box stays inside. A box whose top or bottom leaves the window by more than one pixel fails the same check, except content inside `[data-scrollport]`, which may sit past the top or bottom unless it is position:fixed; a position:fixed box is still reported. Do not size a panel with `vw` or `w-screen`: that
width is the phone, which is wider than the padded column, and that is what shifts a page.
`scripts/check-scrollports.mjs` fails lint on those widths. Every visual screenshot runs
`pageFrameProblems` first, and the Visual job fails when a box sticks out or the page can scroll
sideways.

## Two shells

**Marketing** — `src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` + `/404` (`src/app/not-found.tsx`, which duplicates the shell because it sits outside the group).

- Canvas: `flex h-[var(--app-height)] min-h-0 flex-col bg-ink text-paper [color-scheme:dark]`, with one `[data-scrollport]` (`bg-ink`) around header, page, and footer. The document does not scroll. The ink background stays on the scroller so light theme cannot show through.
- No `ThemeSwitcher`. Cookie theme must not lighten `/`, `/about`, `/legal`, `/terms`, `/stats`, `/handbook`, `/404`.
- Header + footer always mounted.

**App** — every other `page.tsx`. Tokens only. `ThemeProvider` + `THEME_BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT` in the root layout (`html.dark`, cookie `theme`). Every screen uses the one top-left arrow from `ProfileChromeLeft` (or the rules-setup portal of that same arrow). Unsigned app adds LanguageSwitcher. Signed-in adds `SignedInChrome`: the Menu. Setup name and username keep a non-link wordmark. ThemeSwitcher and LanguagePreferenceSwitcher are Profile identity-card settings rows, not chrome.

`/rules` is **app shell** (themeable, no marketing header) even though it is public. Footer links from marketing _into_ `/rules`.

`/donate` is app shell (themeable, unsigned chrome).

**Mobile vs desktop.** Marketing nav hides below `md`, hamburger `md:hidden`. App cards are single-column at all breakpoints. Forum `Card maxWidth="xl"` is the widest app panel. Playwright viewports: desktop and mobile combos already in `scripts/screen-variants.mjs` (`BASELINE_COMBOS`). Do not add a third breakpoint.

**Safe area / visualViewport.** `AppShell` plus `--app-height` (bootstrap script + `useAppHeight` / `AppHeightSync`) is the height source. `--app-height` is the visible viewport: `visualViewport.height`, otherwise `innerHeight`. `--app-offset-top` is `visualViewport.offsetTop` (else 0) and positions `body` (`position: fixed; top: var(--app-offset-top); height: var(--app-height)`). The offset is never added into the height. When the software keyboard shrinks the visual viewport and sets `offsetTop`, the frame keeps the short height and the body moves down onto the visible area. Pinch-zoom (`|scale - 1| > 0.01`) skips both writes. `html { touch-action: manipulation }` disables double-tap-zoom; pinch-zoom stays. Do not add `env(safe-area-inset-*)` here.

**`AppShell` slots.** `AppShell` always draws the page frame: a viewport-height `<main>` with one `rounded-3xl` `<section>`. Chrome (wordmark + Menu / language) is that frame’s first row (`[data-app-chrome]`). `fill` and `flow` share this geometry (`h-[var(--app-height)]`, frame `grow shrink basis-0 self-stretch` not `flex-1`, one inner `[data-scrollport]`). `mode` stays on the API so call sites compile. `PageChrome` still passes `mode="flow"`. Card never hosts page chrome. `surface={false}` is the page-body column (no radius/border/bg/shadow/`p-8`). Default Card is still a nested visual panel for overlays and notes. Never `justify-center` on `<main>` or the overflow scroller. The center wrapper sets `justify-content: center` and then `safe center`, so content that fits stays centered, and where `safe` is supported a thread taller than the frame starts at the top and remains scrollable. Onboarding CTAs register via `AppShellFooter` (and headings via `AppShellHeader`) instead of stretching the form column. Child `AppShellTopLeft` registration wins over the page `topLeft` prop.

**`ProfileChromeLeft`.** One `h-11 w-11` lucide `ArrowLeft` link to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none, plus the wordmark. `tone="dark"` is the ink marketing header. `hideHistoryArrow` omits the arrow on `/welcome`, whatever the view stack holds. An ask-wizard step temporarily replaces the link with the same chrome button. There is no in-card back.

**`MessagesChromeLeft`.** Renders `ProfileChromeLeft` only. The view stack decides the target; `?c=` is not special-cased.

**No wallet button in the header.** The signed-in header row holds only the back arrow, the wordmark, and **Menu**. The balance lives in the Menu's account header (`MenuAccountHeader`, see Menu) and on `/wallet`; the forum home and `/wallet` carry the wallet's **Receive** / **Send** footer (`WalletFooterActions`). Below 360px the shell pad is `px-2` and the chrome row `px-3`, so the back arrow, the wordmark, and Menu fit at 320px.

**Signed-in Menu** (`SignedInChrome`). Labeled Menu trigger (lucide `Menu` 14px + catalog `aria.menu`). The panel starts with the account header (`MenuAccountHeader`, see Menu) and a divider, then rows icon+label, in this order:

Trigger: `inline-flex min-h-11 items-center gap-1.5 px-2 text-sm text-app-muted` in `[data-app-chrome]` (`z-40`). While the fixed overlay is up, the trigger is also `relative z-[60]`, so Menu stays above that panel and still closes it. Otherwise a dialog in the same header still covers Menu. The panel stays mounted (`hidden` when closed) so install state is not remounted. Wide (frame content box ≥ 576px; until measured, `matchMedia('(max-width: 36rem)')`, and missing `matchMedia` counts as wide): portal the panel to the trigger parent, `absolute right-0 z-50 mt-2 w-72 rounded-xl border border-app-border bg-app-card p-2 shadow-lg`. The trigger is only as wide as the button, so a percentage width would collapse the panel; `w-72` (18rem) hangs left from that right edge. No `100vw`. A scrim button `#signed-in-menu-scrim` (`absolute inset-0 z-40 rounded-3xl bg-app-overlay`, `aria.menuDismiss`, not in tab order) is portaled to `[data-menu-scrim-host]` inside `[data-app-frame]`. The radius matches the frame, because the scrim host is `display: contents` and `inherit` would be 0. Narrow (content box < 576px): portal the panel to `[data-menu-sheet-host]` (`px-5`, the same horizontal inset as the page) inside the one scrollport, `w-full`, not absolute, and leave it there while closed (`hidden`) so the portal container does not change. While open, set `html[data-menu-sheet='1']` and hide `[data-scroll-page]`. Read the scrollport `scrollTop` before hiding the page, set it to 0 while open, and write it back after the page is shown again. Escape closes and focuses the trigger. Outside `mousedown` closes only when the target is outside the trigger root and outside `#signed-in-menu`. AppShell `<main>` has no `overflow-hidden`. The document is `overflow: clip`; the page scrollport is `[data-scrollport]`. Rows: `flex min-h-11 items-center gap-1.5 rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium`. A short window drops only the wide panel's outer spacing (`mt-0`, `px-2 py-0`, version line `py-0`) and returns to `mt-2` and `p-2` once that compact box has 48px of room. If the compact panel still passes the window and a non-negative lift keeps the bottom inside, that panel is a `fixed` overlay. Its `style` sets the measured `top`, `left`, and `width` so the bottom sits on the window and the top is never less than 0. That `left` is the trigger parent's right edge minus the panel width, so a horizontal move of the frame does not keep the last inline left. It does not scroll. A row is not shortened below `min-h-11`. When that lift would still leave the bottom outside, the wide menu uses the same sheet as a narrow frame (`w-full`, `html[data-menu-sheet='1']`, scrolling only inside its own border) and does not use a negative top.

**Marketing header** stays dedicated (`MarketingHeader`): sticky, `bg-ink/85 backdrop-blur-xl`, `border-b border-paper/10`, `px-5 py-3.5`. Do not reuse `PageChrome` on marketing.

## Iconography

**Set.** `lucide-react` only. No second icon pack. Drawn exceptions: favicon “21”, the welcome gift-and-Bitcoin SVG, the shop-sticker storefront on every valid pay link, and handbook images.

**Stroke.** Default lucide 2px. At 16px glyph use stroke 2; at 20–24px use stroke 1.75 if the glyph looks heavy on goldens after Outfit — otherwise leave default. Do not mix fills.

**Sizes (glyph, not hit target).**

| Glyph | px  | Tailwind      | Use                                                  |
| ----- | --- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 14    | 14  | `h-3.5 w-3.5` | Menu row icons                                       |
| 16    | 16  | `h-4 w-4`     | Button leading icon, Field-adjacent, pay-sheet close |
| 20    | 20  | `h-5 w-5`     | IconButton md/lg default, profile back               |
| 32    | 32  | `h-8 w-8`     | Login fingerprint / error / spinner                  |
| 48    | 48  | `h-12 w-12`   | Welcome gift-and-Bitcoin SVG; pay-link shop sticker  |

**Decorative vs control.** Decorative: `aria-hidden="true"` (gift-and-Bitcoin SVG on welcome, Fingerprint on login, AlertTriangle on error, legend swatches). Control: `IconButton` with required `aria-label` from the catalog. The Profile menu row is the label only.

**Welcome gift-and-Bitcoin glyph.** Combined gift outline and Bitcoin symbol, `h-12 w-12 text-app-fg`, `aria-hidden`. It is the forum’s page glyph, not the brand mark. Do not color it orange. Do not duplicate it in chrome. On `/pl` it appears only when the link is not valid.

**Pay-link shop glyph.** The shop sticker's storefront, the same paths the printable sticker paints (awning, counter, goods, 21.gifts sign). Not the Open CryptoPay mark from the QR centre, and not a lucide store icon. `h-12 w-12`, `aria-hidden`, on every valid `/pl` (the amount step and the active payment). Colours stay `#F99602`, `#000000`, and `#FFFFFF`.

**React control glyph.** Lucide **`Reply`**. Accessible name is catalog `forum.react` = **“React”** (DE **Reagieren**). Icon-only on every top-level note (`parentId` unset). Click expands the reply composer when the card is collapsed and focuses the reply textarea when it is already expanded. Nested replies have no React control.

**Pay control glyph.** Lucide **`Gift`**, not `Bitcoin`. Accessible name stays catalog `forum.pay` = **“Send Bitcoin”**. Do **not** retune that string to “Pay” (`e2e/visual.spec.ts` uses `getByRole('button', { name: 'Send Bitcoin' })`). Only on payable replies (`parentId` set). The `/welcome` heading uses a 48px decorative gift-and-Bitcoin SVG; the in-card pay control remains a 16px `Gift`.

**Heart control glyph.** Lucide **`Heart`**. Accessible name is catalog `forum.heart` = **“Send ₿1”**. Icon-only. It sits in the card footer after the Translate slot and before React or Gift (`ForumHeartControl`). It shows on a note or reply that is not deleted, not the viewer's own note, and whose author can receive (`payable`), including a signed-out card. It is absent when `deletedAt` is set, when the viewer is the author, when `payable` is false, and on a board that has no heart handler (the external author profile), so no heart is shown that can only fail. A signed-out or read-only tap does nothing: no vibrate, no pressed flash, no send. Every other tap vibrates and shows the filled heart and the literal text `+1` at once, before any request, for 700 ms (the length of the `+1` animation), while the payment runs in the background. A heart that does not go through shows nothing more: no sentence under the heart and no `+1` taken back; it is only reported to error reporting with its reason code and the message id. The one exception is a wallet that is ready with a balance under 1 sat: that tap does not vibrate, shows no press and no `+1`, sends nothing, and shows catalog `forum.heartNeedsBalance` = **“A Bitcoin balance is required for this.”** under the heart. A heart is always exactly 1 sat with no fee: it is paid only through the api's fee-free Spark invoice. Without that invoice, when the prepared payment is not 1 sat or its fee is above ₿0, or when the api answers 503 `HEART_UNAVAILABLE`, nothing is sent. The Lightning invoice is never used for a heart. When the send times out, the payment may still complete: another tap on that note does not pay until the wallet's payment list shows the earlier heart completed or failed, or until it is still not listed after ten minutes.

## Photography

The signed-in profile has three pictures. Each is its own upload. None is filled from another, and a missing wide image or profile photo is a labeled button that adds it. There is no initials circle and no Gift glyph in that slot.

| Forum gallery  | When `photoCount > 1`, `ForumPhotoGallery` is a horizontal snap row (`data-scroll-x`): earlier stills are 88% wide so the next peeks, the last is full width, with a `current/total` chip and dots. The row scrolls sideways only.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The owner editor on `/profile` has a separate control for each of the three pictures. The wide-image control opens the same 5:2 cropper above its preview. Do not use a colored placeholder, a camera badge, or a progress ring.

## Money

**Two currencies, when a second figure exists.** Every visitor has one default fiat in settings (CHF, EUR, USD, or PHP). A value is never shown in only one currency when a stored string or a loaded spot rate exists. If neither exists, the amount stays bitcoin, because there is no second number.

- Defined in that default fiat: show that amount and the bitcoin counterpart. Do not repeat the fiat.
- Not defined in that default fiat (bitcoin, or another fiat): also show the default fiat. An ask defined in another fiat shows three: the defined amount, bitcoin, and the default fiat.
- The default-fiat figure is the string stored for that currency on the row. When that field is null or missing, use the current spot rate if one is loaded. If that rate is not loaded either, the amount stays bitcoin. Do not recompute a stored string.

**Visitor amounts.** Always `formatBitcoin(sats, numberFormat)` from `src/lib/stats-money.ts`. Leading `₿` (U+20BF), `NumberFormatStyle` grouping (`ch` / `us` / `de`), no fraction, no extra ₿. Class: `tabular-nums lining-nums`. JSON fields remain `sats` / `totalSats`.

**Pay control is not a second ₿.** Post footer has no Gift. Nested replies and top-level cards with `parentId` (profile replies feed) show Gift when `payable`:

```
[ ₿21 ]  [ Heart ]  [ React ]  [ Copy ]  [ N reactions ]
```

- Amount: ₿ via `formatBitcoin`, then `·` plus the visitor's default fiat — button that toggles expand (`aria-expanded`; accessible name is the visible ₿ text, not `forum.expand` / `forum.collapse`). A stored string is shown as-is. A null or missing field uses the current spot rate, so the amount is not bitcoin alone while a rate exists (no ` · —` when that rate is unusable). Unsent previews (pay sheet, unpaid invoice, Ask wizard, goal bar) omit the stored amount and use the current spot rate. The posted Ask line follows the same pair rule.
- React (posts only): `IconButton` `variant="ghost"` `size="sm"` (24px painted glyph, 44px hit slop — §10), lucide `Reply` 16px, `aria-label={t('forum.react')}` (**React**). Tests locate it with `getByRole('button', { name: /^React$/ })`.
- Pay (replies only): `IconButton` `variant="ghost"` `size="sm"` (24px painted glyph, 44px hit slop — §10), lucide `Gift` 16px, `aria-label={t('forum.pay')}` (**Send Bitcoin**, frozen). Disabled while `payBusy`.
- Do not put the amount inside the pay control.
- Do not change `forum.pay` copy.

Pay sheet amount step shows a live fiat line in the preferred fiat (no picker; after mint the line uses the invoice amount). Pay sheet confirm sentence (`forum.payConfirm`) is one `formatBitcoin` plus optional `·` `formatFiatDisplay` when the conversion is non-null. Amount-step CTA is **Continue** (`forum.payContinue`) on every user-agent. Continue only requests the invoice. After mint every user-agent sees the invoice card: the confirm sentence, then the in-app wallet slot (Pay sheet). No invoice `QrCode` and no button to another wallet app on any device. The public pay link is the only invoice surface with a wallet-app link: **Pay** (`variant="primary"` `size="md"` `tone="app"`; visible `forum.payOpenWallet`, aria `forum.payOpenWalletAria` “Pay with a Bitcoin wallet app” — sentence-length, **not** accent) sets `window.location.href` to a generic `lightning:` link (`lightningHref`), and its invoice `QrCode` mounts only when the user-agent is not a smartphone (`isSmartphoneUserAgent`, not viewport).

**Fiat.** Cookie `fiat` (otherwise locale default). Switchers: Profile settings (`FiatPreferenceSwitcher`) is the only signed-in writer. `FiatPicker` remains on unsigned `AccountActivityChart` (public `/view`), unsigned `/stats`, and unsigned `/stats/[day]` (`useHydrateSession().ready && session === null`). Signed-in chart, member, and stats/day omit it; ₿|{code} scale stays. Forum notes, nested replies, and the pay sheet **display** that code only (no picker). Stats KPI shows ₿ on the first line and the selected fiat on the second via `formatFiatDisplay` (USD uses `formatUsdDisplay`). Populated profile chart is ₿ | selected FiatCode.

**₿ \| selected-fiat segmented control** — shipped as `SegmentedControl` (see catalog). Stats charts: ₿ and the preferred FiatCode. Profile: ₿ and the preferred FiatCode (same as stats charts, app shell).

The closed forum view is a field (`bg-app-card`), not a selected pill. Post/Ask selected pill stays `bg-app-btn`. The check is `text-app-fg`, not orange. Profile uses `tone="gift"` (app shell). Stats uses `tone="gift" shell="dark"`.

**Empty profile chart.** If both series empty/all-zero sats: unsigned shows FiatPicker plus `profile.chartEmpty` `role="status"`; signed-in empty is `profile.chartEmpty` alone; **no SVG / no ₿|fiat scale**. Empty/all-zero sats and failed is `profile.chartError` `role="alert"`, not `profile.chartEmpty`. Successful empty and in-flight stay `profile.chartEmpty` `role="status"`, no SVG. Null `usd`/`cumulativeUsd` still draws the satoshi chart; USD scale uses an em dash when any raw `cumulativeUsd` is `null`. Legend without data is noise.

## Control grammar

The labeled vs icon-only table is the **binding** rule. Reviewers follow this table and `CONTRIBUTING.md` **Icon controls**, not “everything new is an icon”.

The forum home **+** that opens the writer is icon-only (`IconButton size="xl"`, `forum.writerOpen` “Write a post”, lucide `Plus`). The one top-left back arrow (profile, rules-setup, and an ask-wizard step) stays icon-only. Pay-sheet dismiss is `X` with `forum.payClose` (“Close”), not a back arrow. The wallet send amount step Close is the same `X` with `wallet.sendCancel` (“Cancel”); the wallet send confirm step has no `X` and shows **Cancel** as a labeled text button instead. The wallet Send manual-entry sheet's Close is the same `X` with `wallet.sendCancel`. Copy on a technical value of the payment screen (`/wallet/payment`) is icon-only (`IconButton` ghost, `Copy`, `aria-label` `wallet.payment.copyValue` “Copy {label}”). |

**Skip** (onboarding name) is a labeled `Button` in the same column as **Continue**. There is no Skip on `/setup/username`, `/setup/rules`, or on `RequirementsOverlay`. Ask preview **Post** is a labeled `Button` (`forum.post`); the Post-path messenger send control stays icon-only. Shop wizard **Add a shop**, step **Next**, summary **Post**, and **Save changes** stay labeled in that same column. The photo step's Close (X) is icon-only, accessible name Cancel, the same dismiss as pay-sheet Close, and it is not a second back arrow.

**Notifications** list rows are full-row links/buttons with visible text (not icon-only).

Content translation **Translate** is icon-only (`IconButton` + Languages, `aria-label` = `forum.translate`). Signed forum cards (`ForumBoard`) place it in the footer icon row with the heart after Translate and before react / pay / copy. Surfaces without that row — unsigned public cards, About me, inbox, funding, and hidden notes — stack the control under the body. **Show original** / **Show translation** stay the same Languages icon. The accessible name is the only label; no visible text.

**Member profile** identity card has no edit. A moderator can edit a shop note in that member's posts feed. Back is icon-only like profile (`ProfileChromeLeft`). Member profile **Message** is a labeled `Button` (`profile.message`), not icon-only. Member profile **Shop sticker** is a labeled `Button size="sm" variant="secondary"` (`profile.shopSticker`), not icon-only; its overlay closes with the icon-only ghost `IconButton` like every overlay. **Moderator functions** is a closed `details` / `summary` row, not a `Button`.

**Menu trigger** stays labeled (icon + “Menu”). It is page chrome. Do not convert **Log out**, **Continue**, **Skip**, **Activate**, **Try again**.

Moderator **Trash2** on notes and nested replies is icon-only with inline confirm (`DeletePostControl`).

Do not add a 36px button. Marketing header Log in visual may stay slightly smaller in width but not in height.

## Component catalog

Every primitive: anatomy, tokens, states, React API. New or migrated surfaces compose these. Raw duplicate class strings are rejected.

Shared focus: `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--color-app-focus); outline-offset: 2px }` in `globals.css`. **No `outline-none` on controls** (Field, composer, switchers, buttons).

Disabled: `opacity-50` + `cursor-not-allowed`.

Loading: leading `Loader2` `h-4 w-4 animate-spin` (labeled) or replacing the glyph (icon). Control stays disabled.

### `AppShell` / `PageChrome`

**Anatomy.** `AppShell` always draws one `rounded-3xl` page frame. Chrome (wordmark + Menu / language) is the frame’s first row (`[data-app-chrome]`). `fill` and `flow` share locked-height inner-scroller geometry. Card never hosts page chrome. `PageChrome` is the flow-mode wrapper (`mode="flow"`); prefer `AppShell` on new routes.

**Tokens.** `h-[var(--app-height)]` for both `fill` and `flow`, `<main>` `px-3 py-2` (`px-2` below 360px), `[data-app-chrome]` `px-5 pt-4 pb-1` (`px-3` below 360px), header slot, menu sheet host, and `[data-scroll-page]` `px-5` (page `py-4`), footer `px-5 pb-5`, one inner `[data-scrollport]`, `bg` inherited from `body`. `html` and `body` are `overflow: clip`. Never Tailwind viewport-height utilities on app routes. Never a second scrollport. `ScrollSurfaceGuard` clips any later `auto` / `scroll` / `overlay` overflow, including values set from script. The innermost bound scrollport scrolls; among siblings, the most recently bound one, marked `data-scroll-active`. The others are `data-scroll-locked`. Textareas grow with their text.

**API.**

```tsx
export interface AppShellProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  mode: 'fill' | 'flow';
  topLeft?: ReactNode;
  topRight?: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  align?: 'start' | 'center';
}

export interface PageChromeProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  topRight?: ReactNode;
  topLeft?: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}
```

Slot registrars: `AppShellHeader`, `AppShellFooter`, `AppShellTopLeft` (child registration wins over page `topLeft`). `useAppShellScroller` returns the inner `[data-scrollport]` node, or `null` outside AppShell.

### `Wordmark`

**Anatomy.** Text `21.gifts` as `Link` when `href` is set, otherwise a `<span>`.

**Tokens.** Header `text-[17px] font-bold no-underline`; footer `text-[15px] font-bold no-underline`. Color: `text-paper` (`tone="dark"`) or `text-app-fg` (`tone="app"`).

**API.**

```tsx
export function Wordmark(props: {
  href?: string; // omit → <span>, not a link
  tone?: 'app' | 'dark'; // app = app-fg; dark = paper on ink
  size?: 'header' | 'footer'; // header 17px (default); footer 15px
}): ReactElement;
```

`HomeWordmark` is the session-aware wrapper (`/` until hydrate, `/welcome` when `ready && session !== null`). Do not over-type primitive `href` as `'/' | '/welcome'` — unsigned `/rules` still uses `/`, and the footer is not a link.

### `Card`

**Anatomy.** Default `<section>` is a nested visual panel: children in a column, centered, `gap-6`, `p-8`, `rounded-3xl`, `border border-app-border bg-app-card shadow-sm`, `w-full` + max width. `surface={false}` is the page-body column (width + flex + gap only; no radius, border, bg, shadow, or `p-8`). Page chrome lives on AppShell `[data-app-chrome]`, never on Card. The AppShell frame is the only page-level `rounded-3xl`.

**API.** `maxWidth?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'xl'` default `sm`. `className?`. `surface?: boolean` default `true` (`false` omits panel classes).

**States.** None. Nested notes use `app-card-muted`, not a second `Card`.

### `Button` (labeled)

**Anatomy.** `inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 rounded-full font-medium text-sm`. Optional leading `icon` (decorative). Optional `tone?: 'app' | 'dark'` (default `app`).

**Variants (app tone).**

| Variant     | Default                                                   | Hover              | Disabled   | Use                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary`   | `bg-app-btn text-app-btn-fg`                              | `bg-app-btn-hover` | opacity 50 | Log in, Continue, Try again, I agree, Activate, pay-sheet **Pay** |
| `secondary` | `border border-app-border-strong bg-app-card text-app-fg` | `bg-app-hover`     | opacity 50 | Retry on forum, inbox, notifications                              |
| `accent`    | `bg-app-accent text-app-accent-fg`                        | `opacity-90`       | opacity 50 | App donate **Open the forum**; gift-intent fills                  |

**Dark tone.** Secondary `border border-paper/20 text-paper hover:bg-paper/10`; primary `bg-paper text-ink`; accent `bg-accent text-ink`. Used by `PwaInstall` header/hero (and iOS sheet Close) on marketing ink.

**States:** default, hover, `:focus-visible` (ring), active (color only — no `scale`), disabled, loading (`icon={<Loader2 className="h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />}` + disabled).

**API.** `variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'accent'`; `size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'` (default `md`; `lg` adds `w-full`); `tone?: 'app' | 'dark'`; optional `icon`.

### `ButtonLink`

Same visual variants/sizes as `Button`, rendered as `next/link` `Link` (or `<a>` for external). Used by marketing CTAs and donate **Open the forum**. The 404 page does not use it. Optional `icon`. Optional `aria-label`. Legal **Open the app** is an inline `text-accent` link, not `ButtonLink`. Pay-sheet **Pay** is a `Button`, not `ButtonLink`.

| `tone`          | `variant="secondary"`                                         | `variant="accent"` / `primary`                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app` (default) | `border-app-border-strong bg-app-card text-app-fg`            | accent = `bg-app-accent text-ink`; primary = `bg-app-btn` |
| `dark`          | `border-paper/20 bg-transparent text-paper hover:bg-paper/10` | accent fill unchanged (`text-ink` on orange)              |

`Button` also has `variant="overlay"`: `bg-black/55 text-white backdrop-blur-md hover:bg-black/70` on either tone, for the few controls that float over a camera picture (wallet Send **Paste**, **Enter manually**, **Try again**); call sites add `min-h-12 text-base` so the pill is at least 48px. It is not a page button.

`ButtonLink` also has `size="chrome"`, the compact page-chrome pill: `min-h-11 gap-1 px-1.5 py-1 text-xs`, from `sm` `gap-1.5 px-3 text-sm`. No current screen uses it; it stays for a future chrome pill.

Hero **Send help**: `ButtonLink href="/donate" variant="secondary" tone="dark"`. Header **Log in** / **Ask for help**: `variant="accent"`. The 404 page has no second back button.

### `IconButton`

**Anatomy.** Round control, glyph only, required `aria-label`.

**Variants:** `primary` (`bg-app-btn text-app-btn-fg`), `secondary` (border), `ghost` (`text-app-muted hover:bg-app-hover hover:text-app-fg`). Default `secondary`.

**Tone:** `app` (default) or `dark` (marketing ink). Ghost + `dark` is `text-paper/40 hover:bg-paper/10 hover:text-paper` with `focus-visible:outline-paper`. Handbook copy-link uses this; do not layer `hover:bg-app-hover` on ink.

**Sizes:** `sm` `h-6` + 44px slop; `md` `h-11 w-11`; `lg` `h-12 w-12`; `xl` `h-14 w-14` (56 px, the floating **+** on the forum home). Default `md`.

**Card close (X).** `sm` is `relative` itself, because its 44px hit slop is an absolute `before:` box that needs the button as its containing block. An `absolute` class on an `sm` `IconButton` therefore loses to `relative`, and the button stays in the flow. Position a card's close in a wrapper instead: `<div className="absolute right-3 top-3">` around the `IconButton`, never `absolute` on the `IconButton`. Every dismissible card or notice whose close sits over its content uses that corner and that 12px inset. A dialog card (Introduce yourself, Requirements, External link, Shop sticker) is not one: its `md` close stays in the flex header row beside the title and is not positioned. A pay sheet or wallet Send panel whose `X` sits where back would be keeps the left side with the same inset (`absolute left-3 top-3`). A card whose content is centred pads both sides alike so the content clears the `X` (`px-12`, with `py-5`); then the content's centre is the card's centre. Content beside or under the `X` starts at least 48px from that corner (`pl-12`, `pt-12`), past the 44px hit area, so a tap on the first control never closes the card.

**States:** default, hover, focus-visible, active, disabled (`disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50`), loading (spinner replaces glyph).

Glyph: `aria-hidden` on the lucide node.

### Overlay

**Anatomy.** Full-viewport scrim `fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-app-overlay p-4`. Panel is catalog `Card maxWidth="sm"` (`rounded-3xl border border-app-border bg-app-card p-8 shadow-sm`, `gap-6`). Close is `IconButton` ghost. `role="dialog"` `aria-modal="true"`.

**Introduce yourself.** Only on the forum home (`/welcome`); never over `/wallet`, `/wallet/*`, `/pos*`, `/profile*`, `/messages*`, the setup flow, or any other screen. Title, body, labeled `Button` CTA **Write an introduction**. The CTA dismisses the overlay, opens the forum home writer and focuses its text field (`FORUM_COMPOSE_EVENT` / `requestForumCompose`). Close dismisses this mount. No Skip.

**Requirements.** Name, username, or living-room rules before a pending post retries; a missing wallet (api `lightning-address`, or a `wallet_required` answer on a forum gift, paid reply, or posting fee; the inbox shows its own wallet-required alert link instead) shows `requirements.walletTitle` with `requirements.walletBody` and a labeled **Open your wallet** link to `/wallet`, no form. The wallet is already open for a signed-in member; any one-time setup continues in the background, with no separate setup surface. Close dismisses without posting. No Skip. Username has no Skip.

**External link.** Title **Open external link?**, body warning, destination URL as `text-sm text-app-fg break-all` (user content, not catalogized), labeled **Open link**. Close dismisses without opening. No Skip. App body links stay `font-medium underline underline-offset-2` and inherit colour — not `text-accent`.

**States.** Open / dismissed (parent).

**Shop sticker.** `ShopStickerOverlay` uses the same anatomy with `Card maxWidth="xl"` so the sticker preview is readable: title, muted lead, a full-width **Second language** combobox (closed in the card flow; the list opens downward over the preview), preview `<img>` (`rounded-xl border-app-border`), neutral `SegmentedControl` for PDF | PNG | JPG | SVG (file-format tokens, like the fiat codes), labeled `Button size="lg"` **Download**, `role="alert"` + `text-app-danger` on failure. Escape closes an open language list first, then the dialog. The menu does not write the URL. Options, in order: **None (English only)**, **Spanish**, **German**, **French**, **Filipino**, **Kikamba**. The closed menu starts on the visitor's UI language: English settings show **None (English only)**, and Deutsch, Español, and Filipino settings select that language. The **sticker artwork** inside the preview and the downloaded files is a printed shop-window product, not app chrome: it keeps its own three-colour palette (orange `#F99602`, black, white), the classic Bitcoin wordmark type (Ubuntu) and the Open CryptoPay scan text (Barlow) as outlines, and the orange Open CryptoPay mark inside its QR. App tokens and the Outfit-only rule do not apply to that artwork; the 21.gifts sign on its shop is the Outfit 700 wordmark with an orange **21**. A known `lang` query on the profile or member URL overrides that first selection: `Kikamba` or `kam` also opens the overlay; `fil` or `filipino` selects Filipino; `en`, `none`, or `keine` is English only; Spanish, German, and French have the same aliases as the menu. A missing, blank, or unknown value does not open the overlay and follows the UI language. French and Kikamba are not app languages, so only a query or a later menu choice selects them.

### `Field`

**Anatomy.** `<label className="flex flex-col gap-1 text-left text-sm text-app-fg">` + control.

**Control class.**

```
w-full min-h-11 rounded-2xl border border-app-border-strong bg-app-card
px-4 py-2 text-base text-app-fg placeholder:text-app-subtle
transition focus-visible:border-app-fg disabled:opacity-50
```

16px (`text-base`) so iOS Safari does not auto-zoom on focus. No `outline-none`. The global `:focus-visible` ring is the keyboard encoding. No `error` prop; screens keep external `role="alert"` siblings.

Textarea: add `min-h-11 resize-none`. Composer textareas that sit beside an IconButton may omit the visible label and use `aria-label` only — that is a **composer**, not `Field`. An amount the person types is `AmountEntry`, not `Field`: the gift `SegmentedControl` (₿ | fiat code) and the other unit under the field. The daily payout roster amounts are the stored USD figure, so they stay `Field`. The fiat option is disabled (₿ stays) while that fiat has no spot rate, and the other-unit line then reads **No exchange rate yet**, typed or not. The inbox composer keeps attach, the message, and send on one row and puts that amount on the next row (`layout="composer"`: switch beside the input, counter under the input, label for assistive tech only).

**API.** `FieldProps` input/textarea union (`multiline?: false` / `multiline: true`).

### `SegmentedControl`

Two tones. Gift also takes `shell?: 'app' | 'dark'` (default `app`; ignored for `neutral`).

```tsx
export function SegmentedControl<T extends string>(props: {
  value: T;
  options: readonly {
    value: T;
    label: string;
    badge?: number;
    badgeAriaLabel?: string;
    disabled?: boolean;
  }[];
  onChange: (value: T) => void;
  ariaLabel: string;
  tone: 'gift' | 'neutral';
  shell?: 'app' | 'dark';
  className?: string;
}): ReactElement;
```

A disabled option stays visible, cannot be selected, and is dimmed (`opacity-50`) in both tones. `AmountEntry` uses it for a fiat without an exchange rate.

Chip: an `aria-hidden` span with `ml-1 inline-flex min-w-5 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-app-btn px-1.5 text-xs font-semibold leading-5 text-app-btn-fg`. Omitted when `badge` is missing or ≤ 0. The option button gets `aria-label` only when `badge` > 0 and `badgeAriaLabel` is non-empty.

| Tone + shell    | Track                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Selected                                  | Unselected       | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `neutral`       | `flex w-full rounded-full border border-app-border bg-app-card-muted p-1` on the `role="group"` (so the forum composer Post/Ask `className="!grid grid-cols-2 !rounded-2xl"` still lays out those option buttons). | `bg-app-btn text-app-btn-fg rounded-full` | `text-app-muted` | Forum composer Post/Ask (`className="!grid grid-cols-2 !rounded-2xl"`); staff inbox Direct / Contact / Damus (three pills, one row, no extra `className`); Profile Notifications three neutral tracks (All / Active / Mentions always; Hearts On / Off under the level, default on; This device On / Off when Push APIs are ready) |

The forum composer Post/Ask still uses `className="!grid grid-cols-2 !rounded-2xl"` (two-column grid, not the rounded-full flex pill). The four forum view filters are `ForumModeSelect`, not this control. Staff inbox (moderator) uses the default one-row flex track (three pills, not a 2×2 grid). Members do not mount it. Profile Notifications uses three neutral one-row tracks (All / Active / Mentions always, including while Push APIs are inspected; Hearts On / Off under the level, default on; This device On / Off when Push APIs are ready).

Gift options: `min-h-11 min-w-11 px-2 py-1`. Each option: `type="button"` `aria-pressed`.

### ForumModeSelect

Closed full-width combobox for the living-room forum view (Active / No gifts yet / All / Most popular). Not a pill grid. The shops feed has no view filter; `/shops` mounts this control once, above the Post / Map / Table pill, as the country filter (`ShopsCountryFilter`: **All countries** plus each country that has a shop, labeled with its name and shop count, no chip). Post/Ask stays a SegmentedControl.

```tsx
export function ForumModeSelect<T extends string>(props: {
  value: T;
  options: readonly {
    value: T;
    label: string;
    badge?: number;
    badgeAriaLabel?: string;
  }[];
  onChange: (value: T) => void;
  ariaLabel: string;
}): ReactElement;
```

**Trigger** (`type="button"` `role="combobox"` `aria-expanded` `aria-controls="forum-mode-listbox"` `aria-haspopup="listbox"`):

```
flex w-full min-h-11 items-center justify-between gap-2 rounded-2xl border border-app-border bg-app-card px-4 py-2 text-left text-base text-app-fg
```

Visible text is the selected label. `ChevronDown` is `h-4 w-4 shrink-0 text-app-muted`, aria-hidden. Not `rounded-full` and not `bg-app-btn` on the whole control.

**Panel** (only while open, `role="listbox"` `id="forum-mode-listbox"`):

```
absolute left-0 right-0 z-50 mt-2 rounded-xl border border-app-border bg-app-card p-2 shadow-lg
```

**Option row** (`type="button"` `role="option"` `tabIndex={-1}` `aria-selected`):

```
flex min-h-11 w-full items-center gap-2 rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-left text-sm text-app-fg hover:bg-app-hover
```

Selected row adds `font-medium` and a lucide Check `h-4 w-4 shrink-0 text-app-fg` (not orange). Pointer hover moves the keyboard highlight, so Enter or Space selects the row under the pointer.

**Chip** (same as SegmentedControl): `ml-1 inline-flex min-w-5 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-app-btn px-1.5 text-xs font-semibold leading-5 text-app-btn-fg`, `aria-hidden`. Shown on the closed trigger when any option badge is greater than 0 (the unpaid count, even while another mode is selected). Shown on an option only when that option's badge is greater than 0. Omitted when the badge is missing or not positive. Option `aria-label` is `badgeAriaLabel` only when the badge is greater than 0 and `badgeAriaLabel` is a non-empty string.

### LanguageSwitcher

**Standalone trigger (unsigned chrome, marketing language):**

```
inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 rounded-full border px-3 py-1.5 text-sm min-h-11
```

- Dark tone: `border-paper/20 text-paper hover:bg-paper/10`
- Light tone: `border-app-border-strong text-app-fg hover:bg-app-hover`

Glyph 14px (`h-3.5`) + label + `ChevronDown` 14px. `role="combobox"` + listbox.

**Panel:** `absolute right-0 z-50 mt-2 min-w-[12rem] rounded-xl border p-2 shadow-lg` — dark: `border-paper/10 bg-ink`; light: `border-app-border bg-app-card`.

**Option row:** `flex w-full items-center gap-2 rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm min-h-11`. Selected: `font-medium` + `Check` 16px. Dark selected check: `text-accent`. App selected check: `text-app-fg` (not orange — choosing Deutsch is not a gift).

#### ThemeSwitcher profile settings section

ThemeSwitcher is **app + Profile only**. Anatomy = PushToggle section: uppercase kicker (`theme.label`), then `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` with System / Light / Dark. Not a labeled chrome pill. Not a Menu disclosure. Marketing never mounts it. Unsigned visitors follow the cookie if one exists, otherwise the OS.

#### LanguagePreferenceSwitcher profile settings section

LanguagePreferenceSwitcher is **app + Profile only**. Anatomy = PushToggle section: uppercase kicker (`language.label`), then `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` (default one-row `rounded-full`, same as ThemeSwitcher) with endonyms English / Deutsch / Español / Filipino. Not chrome. Not a Menu disclosure. Marketing never mounts it. Public / unsigned pages keep `LanguageSwitcher` (Globe pill + popover).

#### FiatPreferenceSwitcher profile settings section

FiatPreferenceSwitcher is **app + Profile settings**. Anatomy = PushToggle section: uppercase kicker (`profile.fiatCurrency`), then `FiatPicker` `shell="app"` `tone="neutral"` with CHF | EUR | USD | PHP (selected `bg-app-btn`, not orange). The **only** signed-in control that writes the `fiat` cookie. Unsigned stats, day view, and unsigned `AccountActivityChart` (public `/view`) still mount `FiatPicker` against the same cookie with `tone="gift"` (compact orange). Signed-in chart, member, and stats/day omit it. Not a Menu disclosure. Forum and the pay sheet display the code only.

#### NumberFormatSwitcher profile settings section

NumberFormatSwitcher is **app + Profile only**. Anatomy = PushToggle section: uppercase kicker (`numberFormat.label`), then `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` with sample labels `10'000.23` / `10,000.23` / `23.000,33`. Not a Hash pill. Not a Menu disclosure. Marketing never mounts it. Unsigned visitors keep the Swiss default unless a cookie exists.

### Signed-in Menu

See Layout and chrome. Trigger stays labeled. The panel starts with `MenuAccountHeader` and an `aria-hidden` `border-t` divider (`my-2`): a `rounded-xl bg-app-card-muted p-3` card (compact wide menu adds `mt-2`) with the profile photo (`h-10 w-10` round) or the name's initial in a round `bg-app-border` badge, the name (`text-sm` semibold, line `h-5`) and `@username` (`text-xs text-app-muted`, line `h-4`), both truncated (the photo or initial and the name block together are one `next/link` to `/profile` that closes the Menu, accessible name `nav.openProfile` plus the name and `@username`, `min-h-11` with `-my-0.5 py-0.5` / `-mx-1 px-1` so the row keeps its 40px, `rounded-lg hover:bg-app-hover`, the shared focus ring; not while the account is still loading, and never nested with the balance link or the stats), and in the right corner the balance (`text-base` semibold ₿ over `text-xs` muted fiat, right-aligned, `whitespace-nowrap`) as a `next/link` to `/wallet` that closes the Menu, two skeleton bars of the same size while the wallet connects, nothing while it failed or is unavailable (a wallet that is not open in this tab never reaches the Menu: the central gate shows the login card instead). Under it a three-column `dl`: **Received**, **Given** (each ₿ over a `text-[10px]` muted fiat line), and **Posts**; every value line has a fixed height (`h-4`, fiat `h-3.5`) and shows a skeleton bar (`bg-app-border animate-pulse`, still under reduced motion) until the numbers arrive, `–` when a value could not be read, so nothing shifts. The photo and numbers load when the chrome mounts and are kept for the session. Until the account is loaded (a stored session still being checked right after a page load), the card already has this final size: a round `h-10 w-10` skeleton for the photo and skeleton bars in the name and `@username` lines, so the rows under it never move; signed out there is no card. Rows then start with **Home** and **Balance** (`wallet.balanceHeading`, lucide `Wallet`, `/wallet`). The Profile row shows no amounts. Notifications unread count only when greater than zero. Messages unread count only when greater than zero. Menu has no language, theme, or number format. On a narrow frame the open sheet ends above the shell footer (`html[data-menu-sheet='1']`: host `height: 100%` with `padding-bottom: 1.25rem`, panel `max-height: 100%`) and is itself the bound scrollport while open (`data-scrollport` plus `bindScrollport` / `releaseScrollport`), so its last row scrolls into view and the page port stays locked.

#### Menu loan row

When `summarizeLoans` says an amount is payable, `MenuAccountHeader` adds one `flex items-center justify-between gap-3 rounded-lg bg-app-card px-3 py-2` row under the three account totals. The left column uses `text-[11px]`: muted **Loan repayment due today**, or semibold `text-app-danger` **You're behind on your loan**; the amount below is `text-sm font-semibold tabular-nums lining-nums` with the preferred-fiat suffix and follows the same danger colour when behind. A labeled `ButtonLink size="sm"` **Send** sits right and uses `onNavigate` to close the Menu before `/loans/repay` opens. No payable amount means no row; it does not reserve empty space.

### Loans card

`LoansCard` is `w-full rounded-2xl border bg-app-card-muted p-4`: `border-app-danger/50` when behind, `border-app-success/50` when a funded non-Sunday loan has nothing payable or waiting, otherwise `border-app-border`. On `/welcome` it adds `mt-4` under the heading; on ready `/wallet` it sits in a `-mt-2 w-full max-w-xl` wrapper between the balance and payments. Title is `text-sm font-semibold`, funding status `mt-1 text-sm text-app-muted`, followed by `ForumGoalBar` (one loan keeps its defined currency; multiple loans use combined sats and goal sats). A funded status panel is `mt-3 rounded-xl bg-app-card px-3 py-2`: due and behind use a small label over the amount and a labeled `ButtonLink size="sm"` **Send**; nothing due uses a Check plus an icon-only 44px ChevronRight link; Sunday is one semibold line. Only the wallet placement adds the `mt-1 text-xs tabular-nums lining-nums text-app-muted` waiting-lender line. The **Show loan(s)** disclosure is `mt-3 flex w-full min-h-11 items-center justify-between text-sm font-medium text-app-fg`; opened rows use `mt-2 flex flex-col divide-y divide-app-border`, with an underlined truncated loan-text link and its tabular funding percentage. It is closed by default.

### Banner (living-room laws)

**Anatomy.** `relative rounded-2xl border border-app-border bg-app-card-muted px-12 py-5` (`data-laws-card`). Dismiss `IconButton` ghost `sm` in an `absolute right-3 top-3` wrapper (see **Card close (X)**). The padding is the same on both sides, so the centred text has the card's own centre. Body: two `text-sm text-app-fg` centered sentences + nav links `text-sm font-medium underline underline-offset-2`.

**States.** Visible / dismissed (parent). No error state.

Do not use orange. This is law, not a gift CTA.

### Note card (forum message)

**Anatomy.** `<li className="rounded-2xl border border-app-border bg-app-card-muted px-4 py-3">`.

1. Row: `name` (`text-sm font-medium`) + optional **Badge** + `time` (`text-xs text-app-subtle`).
2. Optional role hint `text-xs text-app-muted`.
3. Optional photo/video (`rounded-xl`, `max-h-80`, `block h-auto shrink-0`, `object-contain`). Multiple stills (`photoCount > 1`) use `ForumPhotoGallery` (horizontal snap row, `data-scroll-x`, 88% peek, `current/total` chip, dots).
4. Body stays `text-sm text-app-fg whitespace-pre-wrap`; when longer than 560 characters (twice the 280-character preview), a 280-character collapsed preview + `…` + inline **Show more** (`forum.showMore`, app inline link). Expand-in-place, no Show less. Permalink `/messages/[id]` is full text. When `place` is set on a top-level note, a MapPin link to `/shops?pin=<id>#map` shows the label, or coordinates when the label is null. Replies do not show a place link.
5. Optional `ForumGoalBar` on a top-level note with a positive `goalSats`: **Ask**, then defined fiat only when `goalCurrency` is USD/CHF/EUR/PHP, then `formatBitcoin(goalSats)`, then the visitor's default fiat unless the ask was defined in that same fiat (the stored snapshot when the string is present, otherwise the spot rate), joined with `·`; orange `app-accent` through 100%, green `app-success` overflow, uncapped percent label. A legacy or BTC ask shows bitcoin plus the visitor's default fiat (frozen snapshot, or the spot rate when that string is missing). An ask defined in the visitor's fiat shows that amount and bitcoin, not a second copy of the fiat. Not on replies. On `/welcome` it sits between body and footer; on unsigned `/messages/[id]` it sits after the amount line. The welcome composer lives in the writer behind the **+**, with a **Send a post** / **Ask for money** pill: Post is attach + text + send; Ask is the four-step wizard (amount starting with the One-time / Daily pill, photos, text, preview with labeled **Post**). There is no leftover Ask field on the Post messenger.
6. Footer: `mt-3 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-x-5 gap-y-2`. Group one, `flex items-center gap-5`, is the amount button (`aria-expanded`, visible `formatBitcoin` text, `text-xs font-medium tabular-nums lining-nums text-app-muted`) then, when `parentId` is unset, the reply-count button (`aria-expanded`, visible `forum.replyCount`, `text-xs text-app-subtle`, no `ml-auto`). Group two, `ml-auto flex flex-wrap items-center gap-5`, is Translate (Languages `forum.translate` when offered), Heart (lucide `Heart`, `forum.heart` “Send ₿1”) on a note or reply that is not deleted, not the viewer's own, and whose author can receive (`payable`), on a board with a heart handler (not the external author profile), including a signed-out card, React when `parentId` is unset (lucide `Reply`, `forum.react` “React”), Gift only when `parentId` is set and `payable`, copy, then on a top-level shop note **Edit shop note** after copy and before a MapPin **Add a place** / **Edit place** and **Add an account** (User icon), then delete. The idle delete glyph is `text-app-danger` and stays icon-only. Confirming delete uses `order-last basis-full w-full` so the bordered confirm group wraps to the next line. Nested reply rows stay `mt-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-5`.

An own, fully funded credit adds the underlined text link **Repay your loan** below the goal bar. It opens `/loans/repay`; the note never grows an inline repayment pay slot.

Expand: header, media, and body text sit in a `role="button"` (click to expand replies). Footer amount and reply count are buttons that also call `onToggleExpand` (accessible names stay the visible ₿ text and reply-count text, not `forum.expand` / `forum.collapse`). React expands a collapsed card and focuses the reply composer when already expanded; it does not collapse. Copy/delete/Translate/Heart stay sibling IconButtons that do not expand. The copy control always copies the card's own `/messages/<uuid>`; its label is `forum.copyLink`, or `forum.copyReplyLink` when the card is a reply (`parentId` set, e.g. the reactions feed of a member profile). Gift is only on a payable reply, never on a post. The action row is a sibling after that control, still inside the `li`. Inner React/pay/copy/delete/Translate/Heart controls `stopPropagation`. Focus ring on the expandable region.
Inbox thread rows use **Inbox thread bubbles**, not this full-width forum chrome.

**Forum moderation.** Moderator `DeletePostControl`: icon-only `Trash2` `IconButton` ghost `sm` with inline confirm (Check / X IconButtons + `forum.deleteConfirm` copy). Nested replies: Translate slot, Heart (`forum.heart`) when the reply is not deleted, not the viewer's own, and `payable`, on a board with a heart handler, Gift `IconButton` (`forum.pay`) when `payable`, a copy `IconButton` (`forum.copyReplyLink`, always present, copies that reply's own `/messages/<id>` permalink), plus the same `DeletePostControl` with `kind="reply"` (`forum.deleteReply` / `forum.deleteReplyConfirm`). Row is always `mt-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-5`. The pay sheet can sit inside that reply `li` when its id is `payMessageId`. No nested reply composer. Not a labeled button.

**Reply money.** The parent footer ₿ figure stays the amount collected on that note. A nested reply does not repeat that total. A gift-only reply is `forum.giftReply` (`text-sm text-app-fg`). A reply with text and sats, and no later receipt, shows the bare formatted amount under the body (`text-sm text-app-muted`). When `receivedSats` is greater than zero, that later receipt is its own `forum.receivedOnReply` line (`text-sm text-app-subtle`) and is not added to what the reply sent. A text reply that has both labels the sent line `forum.sentOnReply` (`text-sm text-app-fg`); the two lines share `mt-2 border-l-2 border-app-border pl-3` so they read as two directions. The same pair is the unsigned public card when the permalink is a reply with `receivedSats` greater than zero. A top-level public card stays one amount. Handbook shots: `/welcome` variants `expanded-donated` (gift only, no receipt), `expanded-text` (sentence, no amount), `expanded-received` (sent and received as two lines), `expanded-received-only` (received line only), and `/messages/[id]` variant `reply-received`.

### Inbox thread bubbles

Inbox direction is unmistakable without a Sent folder and without orange. Incoming is a full-width muted note card; sent is a content-sized filled `app-btn` bubble on the right. Do not use `bg-app-accent` here: sending a message is not a gift CTA. Inbox does not reuse the forum footer (amount, Gift pay, copy, expand). Every settled ₿ amount shown in an inbox/moderator-group thread (gift-only bubble, text+sats line, and the nested gift line below) carries the preferred-fiat suffix stored when that payment was made (` · $X.XX`; a stored string as-is, a null or missing stored field uses the spot rate) via the shared `preferredFiatSuffix` helper. Unpaid invoice previews still use the current spot rate.

**Incoming (`fromMe === false`).** Full-width muted note card (same chrome as the forum note card body): `rounded-2xl border border-app-border bg-app-card-muted px-4 py-3`. Inner: name `text-sm font-medium text-app-fg`, time `text-xs text-app-subtle`, body through `ForumQuotedBody` (`mt-2 whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm text-app-fg`, conversation remainder, nested forum quotes still translate) so a pasted `/messages/<uuid>` URL unfurls; attached stills `inbox.photoAlt` under the body.

**Sent (`fromMe === true`).** Filled form-primary, right, content-sized: `self-end w-fit max-w-[85%] rounded-2xl rounded-br-md bg-app-btn px-4 py-3 text-app-btn-fg`. No border, no muted fill. Inner: name `text-sm font-medium text-app-btn-fg`, time `text-xs text-app-btn-fg/70`, body through `ForumQuotedBody` (`text-app-btn-fg`, conversation remainder). Label `inbox.you`.

**List outbound last-text.** Compact sent chip on the right of the conversation row, same fill: `self-end w-fit max-w-full line-clamp-2 rounded-2xl rounded-br-md bg-app-btn px-3 py-1.5 text-sm text-app-btn-fg`. Copy stays `inbox.sentPreview`. The conversation list does not offer Translate. Unread inbound rows use a semibold counterpart name (`font-semibold`) and last text `line-clamp-2 text-sm text-app-fg`; read inbound last text stays `line-clamp-2 text-sm text-app-muted`. When the derived unread message count is greater than zero, digits sit right of the name, before the time, `text-sm font-semibold tabular-nums lining-nums` (same as the Menu unread count); the word Unread is not visible text. Accessible name is `inbox.threadUnread` (`{name}, {count} unread`). Empty `lastText` omits the preview (gift-only last rows with `lastSats > 0` show the formatted amount with the same chip vs muted split). Thread bubbles above are unchanged.

**Attached gift (`giftFor`).** A message whose `giftFor` points at another message renders
inside that parent's bubble (the parent `<li>`), as a footer line below the parent's text — not
a second bubble — so it reads as part of that message. A hairline separates it: `mt-3 border-t
pt-2`, `border-app-border` in an incoming bubble and `border-app-btn-fg/20` in an own
(`fromMe`) bubble. Text follows the bubble it sits in: name/amount `text-xs tabular-nums
lining-nums text-app-muted` (incoming) or `text-app-btn-fg/80` (own), time `text-xs
text-app-subtle` or `text-app-btn-fg/70`. `role="note"`. Content: `{name} ·
{formatBitcoin}` plus the preferred-fiat suffix, and a right-aligned `formatForumTime`. The
gift's own `text` is never shown here (the parent already names the person).
`aria-label` is catalog `inbox.giftForLabel` (**Paid by {name}: {amount}**), `amount` being
the ₿ text plus fiat suffix text when present. `data-message-id` stays the gift's own id;
`data-gift-for` is the parent message's id.

### Composer

**Anatomy.** Top-level forum note: **Send a post** / **Ask for money** `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` (`forum.composePost` / `forum.composeAsk`, 2-col `!rounded-2xl`). Post is attach + textarea + Send. Ask is `ForumAskWizard` (amount → photos → text → preview with labeled **Post**; step 1 and the preview start with the One-time / Daily pill). There is no leftover Ask field on the Post messenger. Forum reply: two rows. The first is `AmountEntry` `layout="inline"` (`forum.replyAmountLabel`, `id="forum-reply-amount"`): the amount field and the bitcoin/fiat switch share that line. The second is one text line and Post, the same height, side by side (`flex items-center gap-2`). If that form would sit past the shell, it scrolls into view. Contact/inbox list: `items-end`. Inbox open thread and Moderators group (`showAttach`): form `flex-col gap-2`; first row is attach `IconButton` + textarea + send (`flex items-center gap-2` when there is no amount, so the staff room stays centered; `items-end` when the amount row is shown); when `showAmount` (inbox Direct/Contact/Damus, not the staff room) the amount is the next row (`AmountEntry` `layout="composer"`, switch beside the input, other unit under it, indented to the message); the staff room hides the amount; still previews are a row below.

- Ask wizard (forum note only, when Ask is selected): heading + `{step} of {total}` on one row (step on the right). Step 1 and the preview begin with the same neutral two-column pill (`forum.askOnce` / `forum.askDaily`, aria `forum.askCadenceLabel`). Step 1 then shows `AmountEntry` `id="forum-ask-amount"` `forum.askAmountLabel` (Continue disabled until the parsed sats are 1..10_000_000; bitcoin entry shows the preferred fiat under the field, fiat entry shows the bitcoin equivalent); step 2 photos (Continue, photos optional); step 3 text; step 4 preview card with photo/text, `ForumGoalBar` at 0 collected (fiat draft: typed amount plus local Bitcoin; Bitcoin draft: Bitcoin plus live fiat) and labeled **Post** (the only Ask submit).
- Attach: `IconButton` lg secondary, lucide `ImagePlus`, `aria-label` attach. Forum note composer (Post path and Ask step 2), and inbox composer when `showAttach` (Moderators group; JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 10).
- Place: `IconButton` lg secondary, lucide `MapPin`, `aria-label` `forum.addPlace`, immediately after the photo button on the forum note composer only (not replies, not inbox). Optional. Confirming a pin stores it with the note. No Google key: the panel says the map is not available and does not set a pin.
- Textarea: `min-h-11 flex-1 resize-none rounded-2xl border border-app-border-strong px-4 py-2.5 text-base`. 16px so iOS Safari does not auto-zoom on focus. `aria-label` from catalog. `maxLength` from API constants. The forum reply line is the exception: `h-12 px-4 text-base leading-6` and no vertical padding, so the one line matches the send button.
- Amount (forum reply only): `AmountEntry` `layout="inline"` `forum.replyAmountLabel`. The field and the bitcoin/fiat switch are one row above the text. Empty stays empty and invoices 1 sat for non-exempt visitors; `0` becomes 1.
- Send/Post: Post path `IconButton` lg primary, lucide `Send`. Ask preview: labeled `Button` `forum.post`. Loading: `Loader2`.
- Preview row: `rounded-2xl border bg-app-card-muted p-3` + 80×80 thumb + remove `IconButton`.
- Goal bar lives on the note card and on Ask preview, not on the Post messenger (see Note card).

**States.** Default, disabled (`posting`), validation `role="alert"` under the row (`text-sm text-app-danger`) including empty-post. Invalid Ask keeps Continue disabled on step 1.

### Pay sheet

**Amount step.** Inner `rounded-xl border bg-app-card p-3 pl-12 pt-12`. Close `IconButton` (`X`, `forum.payClose`) in an `absolute left-3 top-3` wrapper. `AmountEntry` (`forum.payAmountLabel`): bitcoin entry shows the preferred fiat under the field, fiat entry shows the bitcoin equivalent. A blank field is 21 sats in either unit. Alerts. `Button` primary:

- Every user-agent: **Continue** (`forum.payContinue`). Click only requests the invoice, then the invoice card.

**Invoice step.** Centered column, Close `IconButton` (`X`, `forum.payClose`) in an `absolute left-3 top-3` wrapper, confirm sentence with one `formatBitcoin` and optional `·` plus `formatFiatDisplay` when the conversion is non-null, then the in-app wallet slot on every user-agent. There is no invoice `QrCode` and no button that hands the payment to another wallet app.

**In-app wallet slot (`WalletPay`).** The member pays from the in-app wallet only: the `sparkInvoice` when the api issued one, otherwise the payment request `pr`. The same slot serves the forum gift pay sheet, the reply pay page, the posting fee in the composer, and the inbox pay sheet. `/loans/repay` has its own one-tap multi-bill pay area and reuses only `WalletOwnAddress` for top-up.

- Not available (the wallet is not configured, or the account cannot unlock one): `<p role="status">` muted `wallet.payUnavailable`.
- Preparing and paying: `Loader2` `h-6 w-6 animate-spin text-app-subtle`, then `<p role="status">` `wallet.payPreparing` (**Checking your wallet…**) or `wallet.paying` (**Paying from your wallet…**). The waiting line stays under it.
- Confirm: labeled `Button variant="primary"` **Send** (`wallet.payFromWallet`). Only when the quoted fee is above ₿0, `text-xs tabular-nums lining-nums text-app-muted` **Fee {amount}** (`wallet.payFee`, `formatBitcoin` plus the preferred-fiat suffix) sits above it; in-app payments quote ₿0, so the row is usually absent. On the posting fee of a new post or reply (`postsOnPay`), that button says **Pay {amount} and post** (`wallet.payAndPost`, `formatBitcoin` of the sheet amount in one `text-center` span, without a fiat suffix), because paying also posts.
- Too little balance: `role="alert"` `text-app-danger` `wallet.payInsufficient`, then `wallet.payMissing` in `text-sm tabular-nums lining-nums text-app-fg` with the default fiat (amount plus the known fee minus the balance; absent while the balance is unknown), then muted `wallet.payAddFunds`, the member's 21.gifts address in `font-mono text-sm`, and its Open CryptoPay `QrCode` (the same QR as `/wallet`, so it is shown on a smartphone too; in a `w-full max-w-[266px]` wrapper so it shrinks to fit a narrow card and never grows past its usual size). Without an address (no username), only the address and QR are left out; the alert and `wallet.payMissing` remain. While this shows, the slot reads the synced balance every 4 s; once the balance covers the amount and the known fee, the address and QR go at once, the slot prepares again, and it stops at **Send** (with the fee row only for a fee above ₿0). It never pays without that tap.
- Failed (the wallet could not connect, could not prepare this payment, or prepared another amount): `role="alert"` `text-app-danger` `wallet.payFailed`, then labeled `Button variant="secondary"` **Try again** (`wallet.payRetry`), which reconnects or prepares again.
- Setup failed: `WalletSetupNote`, a `role="alert"` line in `text-app-danger` with `walletSetup.error` (**Your wallet could not be set up yet.**) and a secondary **Try again** `Button` under it. It replaces the normal pay controls until setup is retried.
- Not confirmed yet: `<p role="status">` muted `wallet.payUnconfirmed`. Neutral, not an alert.

Waiting: `text-xs text-app-muted`. Author-wallet error: `role="alert"` `text-app-danger`.

Do not restyle QR for dark mode.

### Badge (Verified, Moderator, Founder)

**Anatomy.** `rounded-full border border-app-border-strong px-2 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-app-muted`. Button when the hint is togglable (`aria-expanded`). Basis role: **no badge**.

**Do not** color-code roles (no green verified, no orange founder). Type + optional hint is the encoding. Hint copy already in catalogs (`forum.role.*Hint`).

The same anatomy is reused for an **External** badge (`forum.via.nostr`), shown for a row with `via: 'nostr'` — written by someone with no 21.gifts account (shown because they sent bitcoin to a post). The badge word is technology-neutral because of Principles §4 (visitors are never shown the underlying protocol). On the forum board it is an interactive button with a togglable hint paragraph (`forum.via.nostrHint`, same slot and one-open toggle as a role pill); on the unsigned permalink card, the quoted/nested note card, the external author profile (`/messages/[id]/author`), and the moderators' hidden list (`/moderate/hidden`, `HiddenNotesScreen`) it is a non-interactive `<span>` with no hint. Never color-coded, same as role badges.

### Chart

**Stats (marketing, ink).** KPI tiles: `rounded-2xl border border-paper/10 p-5`. dt `text-sm text-paper/60`, dd `text-2xl font-semibold tabular-nums`. Charts: stroke/fill `accent`, grid `paper/8`, ticks `paper/50` 12px Outfit. Person bars `rx={6}` height 12. Month bars square fill accent. Empty: copy “No gifts recorded yet.” — **no empty SVG axis**. Loading: `text-paper/60` “Loading…”. Error: copy + `ButtonLink`/`Button` accent **Try again**.

**Profile activity.** FiatPicker only when `useHydrateSession().ready && session === null` (unsigned public view). Signed-in mounts omit it. Legend Given (`app-chart-given`) + Received (`app-chart-received`) with 10px swatches + text (color is **not** the only encoding — labels exist). Populated: ₿|{FiatCode} `SegmentedControl tone="gift"`. SVG height 110 viewBox 400×110, ticks 9px `app-muted`. Unsigned empty: FiatPicker plus `profile.chartEmpty` `role="status"`, no SVG. Signed-in empty: `profile.chartEmpty` alone. Empty series and failed is `profile.chartError` `role="alert"`, not `profile.chartEmpty`. Successful empty and in-flight stay `profile.chartEmpty` `role="status"`, no SVG. Null `usd`/`cumulativeUsd` still draws the satoshi chart; USD scale uses an em dash when any raw `cumulativeUsd` is `null`.

### Alert / error

```
<p role="alert" className="text-center text-sm text-app-danger">
```

Load and request failures next to labeled **Try again** use this grammar (`login.error`, `forum.error`, `forum.repliesError`, `inbox.error`, `notifications.error`, `view.error`, `map.error`, `wallet.payment.error`). Login error also uses decorative `AlertTriangle` `h-8 w-8 text-app-subtle` above the sentence, then `Button` **Try again**. Validation alerts already use the same `role="alert"` + `text-app-danger`. Missing (`view.missing`) stays muted, not danger. Do not use color alone — the sentence is required.

**Wallet setup runs in the background.** Login opens the wallet and places its recovery phrase in tab memory; a new account's sign-up passkey already does the same. Once an eligible account has a username, setup begins independently and may finish during onboarding or any later screen. It is not part of the signed-in gate, so it never delays a new member's onboarding and never opens a modal or separate prompt. While setup is due or has failed, **Receive** still opens; its view shows **Opening your wallet…** (or, after the setup gave up, `WalletSetupNote`) where the unregistered address and QR would go, and the point of sale hides them. If quiet retries are exhausted, only money screens show `WalletSetupNote`: the wallet balance (on `/wallet` and on a payment's `/wallet/payment` screen), the wallet Receive view (on `/wallet` and over the forum home), pay slot, or point of sale. Its `role="alert"` sentence is followed by a secondary **Try again** button; non-money screens stay unchanged.

**No PRF, no wallet on this device.** When the login card's passkey answers without PRF output, the phone or browser cannot hold a 21.gifts wallet. On a held-back signed-in screen, show the one sentence `wallet.prfUnsupported` (**This phone or browser cannot hold a 21.gifts wallet. Please use an up-to-date phone or browser that supports passkeys.**) above **Log in**; another failure or a dismissed prompt shows `login.error`. Sign-up on `/login`, **Activate** on `/view/[viewKey]`, **Add/Show recovery phrase**, and the renew dialog keep the same one unsupported-device sentence in their existing alert grammar. Background setup and the pay slot never open their own passkey prompt. Do not add a second wording for the same case.

### Marketing header / footer / CTA pair

**Header.** Sticky `z-50 flex items-center justify-between border-b border-paper/10 bg-ink/85 px-5 py-3.5 backdrop-blur-xl`. Left: one `flex items-center` group with `ProfileChromeLeft tone="dark"` and `HomeWordmark tone="dark"`. Right: `nav` (how, happyland, why, faq, about, stats, handbook) `text-sm text-paper/80 gap-6` + `ButtonLink variant="accent" size="sm"` **Log in** + `PwaInstall tone="dark" placement="header"` + `LanguageSwitcher tone="dark"` + hamburger (`flex min-h-11 min-w-11 flex-col items-center justify-center gap-1.5 lg:hidden`, three `h-0.5 w-5` bars, `aria-label` menu, `aria-expanded`).
Below the `lg` breakpoint, use the menu toggle so the translated links fit without horizontal overflow. Mobile open nav: `absolute top-full inset-x-0 flex flex-col border-b border-paper/10 bg-ink px-5 py-4`. Log in pill is inside the nav on mobile. Happyland follows How it works in both layouts, uses the shared `nav.happyland` catalog label in all four locales, and links to `/#happyland`. The existing photo essay uses `scroll-mt-24` to keep its anchor clear of the sticky header. Selecting the link closes the mobile menu.

**Footer.** `border-t border-paper/10 px-5 py-10`. Inner `mx-auto flex max-w-[1100px] flex-col items-start gap-6 sm:flex-row sm:items-center sm:justify-between`; the nav wraps (`flex flex-wrap gap-4`). Wordmark footer size, not a link. Nav `text-sm text-paper/70 gap-4` (how, why, faq, about, handbook, legal, rules). GitHub `text-sm text-paper/70`. Below the row: centered italic `text-sm text-paper/50` verse plus uppercase `text-xs tracking-widest text-accent` reference (`footer.verse` / `footer.verseRef`).

**Hero CTA pair.** `flex flex-wrap gap-4 mt-10`. Primary `ButtonLink href="/login" variant="accent"` **Ask for help**. Secondary `ButtonLink href="/donate" variant="secondary" tone="dark"` **Send help**. Then `PwaInstall tone="dark" placement="hero"`.

**Signed-in menu Install.** `PwaInstall placement="menu"` stays the labeled row — app shell, not dark Button.

Do not illustrate empty states with extra glyphs except the welcome gift-and-Bitcoin SVG which is always present.

### Focus ring

Global. 2px `app-focus`, offset 2px. On ink, ring is paper; on paper, ring is `#171717`. Do not use orange rings (fails 3:1 on white — WCAG 1.4.11).

### Notifications list

**Anatomy.** `Card maxWidth="xl"` `surface={false}` + **h1** `notifications.heading` at the **h1** ramp. Unread rows (`readAt` absent) are one list under an `h2` **Unread**, above rows that already have `readAt` under an `h2` **Already seen**. Both headings use the **section** ramp and are not centered. Each list keeps fetch order. A heading and its list are omitted when that group has no rows. Rows (posts, replies, payments, and hearts) are full-width buttons (`w-full` `rounded-2xl border border-app-border bg-app-card-muted px-4 py-3`): actor title (`{name} posted` / `{name} replied` / `{name} sent bitcoin` / `{name} sent you a heart`) + time. Unread: semibold `text-app-fg`. Read: actor `font-medium`, body `text-app-muted`. Time: `text-xs text-app-subtle`. Photo-only post body: `notifications.photoPost` (**Photo**). Photo-only reply body: `notifications.photoOnly` (**Photo reaction**). Zap body is the stored amount. Empty: `notifications.empty`. Loading: `notifications.loading`. Error: `role="alert"` `text-app-danger` + labeled **Try again** (`Button` secondary). Click a reply or mention row → `/messages/{replyId}`. Click a post, payment, or heart row → `/messages/{parentId}`. Ids are URI-encoded. No composer.

### Member identity card

**Anatomy.** Identity page column `Card` `max-w-sm` `surface={false}` (no nested `rounded-3xl`; the AppShell frame is the page panel): **h1** `profile.title` at the **h1** ramp, then chart, About me (not a forum post; Languages **Translate** on the filled read-only text when the note id is set; the editor has no control; copy-profile-link lives inside `AboutMeSection`), optional Message, name, location (read-only; `location.unset` when empty), public `username@21.gifts` (`profile.giftsHeading`; the member's only address), optional role pill. Activity **Posts** / **Reactions** are labeled `Button size="sm"` toggles (`type="button"` `aria-pressed`; pressed = `variant="primary"`, otherwise `variant="secondary"`). They are not the 2-col forum `SegmentedControl` (that requires always-one-selected). Labeled staff Trust Chain actions (`MemberTrustActions`: Verify / Propose / Confirm / Appoint) sit inside the closed **Moderator functions** disclosure, not always visible, when the viewer is staff and the subject is someone else. Failed staff writes use `role="alert"` + `text-app-danger`. On-demand post/reply `ForumBoard` feeds below the card. No edit. `RequirementsOverlay` without Skip when a reply is missing a requirement. When a username is set, a centered `QrCode` (label `profile.giftsQr`) under the address encodes `openCryptoPayQrValue` (`https://<domain>/pl/?lightning=` plus the uppercase LNURL of `https://<domain>/.well-known/lnurlp/<local>`), including on a smartphone. A missing username shows no QR. Under the QR a labeled `Button size="sm" variant="secondary"` **Shop sticker** (`profile.shopSticker`) opens `ShopStickerOverlay`, including on a smartphone.

## Screen recipes

Composition is top-to-bottom. Source of visual composition: the `page.tsx` plus the screen component. Source of variants: `docs/handbook/screens.md` (name the states; do not duplicate every screenshot). **Do not reintroduce** Gift-as-₿, empty-chart axis, missing Wordmark, orange **text** on paper, labeled Contact Send, or claim `bg-neutral-900`.

### `/` — marketing home

`MarketingHeader` → hero (`display` H1 two lines, `body-lg` lead, CTA pair **Ask for help** / **Send help** / `PwaInstall`) → `#how` (kicker, h2, lead, 3 numbered steps) → `#happyland` (localized photo essay; accent kicker, h2 and lead, full-width lead photograph, asymmetric text/image groups, three portraits; intrinsic image proportions and visible captions; stacked on mobile) → `#why` (kicker, h2, three h3+body in `sm:grid-cols-2`) → `#project` (kicker, h2, lead, the platform account's 21.gifts address as `text-accent` code link to `lightning:`; the section renders only when the build names the platform account) → `#faq` (kicker, h2, `details/summary` `border-b border-paper/10 py-4`) → `MarketingFooter`.

Handbook states: live marketing home.

### `/about`

`MarketingHeader` → `main` → first section `px-5 pt-28 pb-12 sm:pt-36` `max-w-3xl` (accent kicker, H1 `text-4xl sm:text-5xl font-semibold leading-tight tracking-tight` — reading width, not the home display 60px, `body-lg` lead, `blockquote border-l-2 border-accent` italic verse + uppercase accent reference) → second section `max-w-3xl px-5 py-16` (three `article`s, each accent number + h2 + `text-paper/60` body; first article also a second paragraph and a verse blockquote; then `ButtonLink href="/welcome" variant="accent" tone="dark"` **Open the living room**) → `MarketingFooter`. Visitor copy is catalogized; English `title`/`description` metadata is the documented exception. No second typeface, no cross. No separate “origin” section — the convictions carry it.

### `/legal`

`MarketingHeader` → `main max-w-3xl px-5 py-24` → H1 Legal Notice, H2 Imprint (`text-xl font-semibold`), body, accent **Open the app** → H2 Privacy Policy (`text-3xl font-semibold`), H3 Overview (`text-xl font-semibold`)… → footer. English legal body is a catalog exception. Inline links `text-accent underline underline-offset-2`.

### `/terms`

`MarketingHeader` → `main max-w-3xl px-5 py-24` → H1 **Terms of Use** (`text-3xl font-semibold`, same as `/legal`), muted `text-sm text-paper/60` last-updated line, H2 **Wallet and data** (`text-xl font-semibold`, `id="wallet-and-data"`), then an `ol` (`list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 text-paper/70`) of five clauses, each opening with a bold `text-paper` heading → footer. Unlike `/legal`, every string is catalogized in all four locales; English `title`/`description` metadata is the documented exception.

### `/stats`

Header → `main max-w-[1100px] px-5 pt-16 pb-24` → display/h1 “Gifts” (`text-4xl sm:text-6xl font-semibold leading-tight tracking-tight`) → body-lg subtitle → `StatsDashboard` (KPI grid, then charts or empty). `SegmentedControl tone="gift" shell="dark"`. Numeric figures.

Handbook states: loading, empty, error + **Try again**, populated charts.

### `/trust-chain`

Fill `AppShell` `align="start"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"`; heading at in-app title (`text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-app-fg sm:text-3xl`), lead `text-app-muted`; `TrustChainLoader` / `TrustChainScreen` / `TrustChainDiagram`; app tokens not paper/ink; founder seeds then hop-on-click; empty/loading/error + **Try again**; hop-error keeps the diagram. Modifier-click opens `/members/{id}`.

Handbook states: default, expanded, empty, loading, error, hop-error.

### `/stats/[day]`

**All stats** link `text-accent underline underline-offset-2` to `/stats` (not a second back control) → display “Gifts on YYYY-MM-DD” (`text-4xl sm:text-6xl font-semibold leading-tight tracking-tight`) → subtitle → `DayLoader` / `GiftDayTable`. Invalid day: `notFound()` (404 shell).

### `/handbook` (+ screens / functions / endpoints)

Marketing shell, `max-w-[1100px] px-5 py-24`, `HandbookIntro`, accent section links. Screens page: three-level contents (chapter / screen / variant), compact cards with ~220px thumbs, description, permalink/copy-link, and click-to-lightbox full size. Handbook markdown is English (catalog exception). No Playwright goldens of these documentation pages. `/handbook/screens` shows product-screen goldens and is not itself a golden.

### `/login`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft wordmark={<HomeWordmark />} />}` `topRight={<LanguageSwitcher tone="light" />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="login"` → `LoginCard` (`Fingerprint` 32px subtle, **one** heading `login.heading` at **card-title**, `Button` primary md with Fingerprint icon **Log in**, then the muted line `login.newHere` (**New to 21.gifts?**, `text-center text-sm text-app-muted`), then `Button` `variant="secondary"` **Open a new account** (no icon, no viewKey; opens the name form without a passkey prompt)). After login `NotAllowedError` (not in-app): heading `login.choiceHeading` at **card-title**, labeled `Button` primary **Log in with existing account** (Fingerprint icon allowed) and `Button` `variant="secondary"` **Open a new account** (no icon, no viewKey). No auto-create.

Starting: `Loader2` + `login.preparing`. Error: `AlertTriangle` + alert + **Try again**. Choice: as above. **Open a new account** on the idle card, the choice card, and the unknown card opens the name form and does not start create. Name: same Fingerprint, **one** heading `login.nameHeading` (**Choose your name**) at **card-title**, muted `login.nameBody`, label `login.nameLabel` (**Name**), `Button` primary **Continue** (`login.nameSubmit`). Continue starts create only after the name normalises; an empty, invalid, or taken name stays on this form (`login.nameInvalid` / `login.nameTaken`). Dismissing that create ceremony (`NotAllowedError` or `AbortError`) returns to the name form. After passkey finish 400 `{ "error": "Unknown credential" }`, the card heading is `login.unknownHeading`, the muted sentence is `login.unknownBody`, and the buttons are primary **Open a new account** and secondary **Try again** (`login.retry`). **Try again** calls `passkey.login` and does not create an account. Dismissing the Try again login prompt stays on this card and does not open the account-choice card. In-app: `InAppBrowserView`.

**Do not reintroduce** an outer “Log in to 21.gifts” title.

### `/donate`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `ProfileChromeLeft` with `HomeWordmark` + LanguageSwitcher. Inner `max-w-md` column: **h1-lg** `donate.pageTitle` (**Send help**), muted lead, `ButtonLink variant="accent"` **Open the forum** to `/welcome`. Keep orange (gift-intent). The forum CTA is not a second back control.

### `/setup/name`

Fill `AppShell` `align="start"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft wordmark={<Wordmark />} />}` (span, not a link) `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="name"` → `NameSetup`: `AppShellHeader` **h1** “Your name” → `NameForm onboarding` (prompt, `Field`, alert, **Continue** and labeled **Skip** in `AppShellFooter`).

### `/setup/username`

Fill `AppShell` `align="start"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft wordmark={<Wordmark />} />}` (span, not a link) `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="username"` → `UsernameSetup`: `AppShellHeader` **h1** “Your 21.gifts name”, hint (`setup.usernameHint`, left out once `sparkWalletVerified` is true), `UsernameForm onboarding` (field, alert, **Continue** in `AppShellFooter`). No Skip. Once `sparkWalletVerified` is true the field shows the current username, field and **Continue** are `disabled`, and a muted line `setup.usernameFrozen` (linked by `aria-describedby`) says why. Handbook states: default, username-frozen.

### `/setup/rules`

Fill `AppShell` `align="start"` with `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}` and a fallback `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft wordmark={<Wordmark />} />}`, shown only while `OnboardingGate` shows the login card in place of the screen, so that state keeps its one back arrow. `OnboardingGate screen="rules"` → `RulesSetup` portals `AppShellTopLeft`: Wordmark **span** plus one arrow (previous chapter when the index is above 0, otherwise the previous in-app view). `AppShellHeader`: **h1** Living room rules, prompt, progress `1 of 9`. Chapter body (`RulesDocument` slice). Alert. On the last chapter only, a centered `text-sm text-app-muted` line **By continuing you accept the Terms of Use.** with an inline `text-accent underline underline-offset-2` `next/link` to `/terms`, directly above the button (no checkbox, no extra step). `Button` primary lg **Continue** or **I agree to these rules**. No Skip. B′: overlines `text-app-subtle`; Welcome `Check` `text-app-fg`; THE TEST `border-l-2 border-app-accent`.

### `/welcome` (forum)

`PageChrome` `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft hideHistoryArrow wordmark={<ForumHomeWordmark />} />}` `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card surface={false}` `max-w-xl` (page column inside the AppShell frame; the frame is the only page-level `rounded-3xl`) → decorative gift-and-Bitcoin SVG 48px → **one** `h1` “Welcome, {name}” → `LoansCard` when the member has a collecting or repaying loan → `DailyPayoutStoppedNotice` shows usernames `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, and `jewel-bacolbas` the Apply link, and every other account the paused sentence → `ForumLoader` / `ForumBoard`:

- No Forum heading. **Do not reintroduce** one.
- Laws `Banner`.
- `ForumModeSelect`: one closed full-width combobox showing the selected label and ChevronDown; open listbox with a check on the selected row; unpaid count chip on the closed trigger when the count is positive and unpaid is not selected; omitted at 0 and when unpaid is selected. Not a pill grid.
- No composer on the page. A round **+** (`IconButton size="xl"` primary, `shadow-lg`, `forum.writerOpen`) floats in the frame body through `AppShellOverlay`: `right-[11px]` (24 px from the window edge), 23 px above **Receive** / **Send** (`bottom-[calc(4.75rem+23px-1.75rem*var(--footer-collapse,0))]` while `[data-footer-actions]` is in the body, else `bottom-6`), hidden while a wallet view or the writer is open. While a post's reaction form, a gift sheet or a reaction's pay slot is open in the feed, or a text field in the page has the focus, it fades out (`opacity-0 invisible pointer-events-none`, 250 ms `ease-glide`, none with reduced motion) and **Receive** / **Send** fold away (`WalletFooterActions` `folded`: the row `grid-rows-[0fr]`, transparent, footer `pb-0`, 280 ms `ease-glide` while the body carries `data-footer-folding`), so a form never has the **+** over its controls and keeps the height above the keyboard; both come back when the focus leaves and no form is open. `/wallet` never folds. It opens the writer: an `AppShellOverlay` `Scrollport` (`absolute inset-0 z-30 rounded-b-3xl bg-app-card`) from the chrome row's bottom edge to the frame's, inner column `flex flex-col gap-4 px-5 pt-6 pb-6`: centred `h2` (`text-base font-semibold`, `forum.composePost` / `forum.composeAsk`), the Post / Ask `SegmentedControl`, then the Ask wizard or the Post composer (on a touch device in its phone shape: the textarea on top at full width, `order-first basis-full`, then attach and place on the left and send on the right, `ml-auto`), the posting-fee pay slot and the composer errors. The text field takes the focus in the opening tap. The top-left arrow (`nav.back`, after any Ask step) is its only close; a successful post closes it. Reply, inbox and every other composer keep their layout.
- Note cards / empty / loading / error (`middle`): amount `formatBitcoin` plus optional `·` `formatFiatDisplay` of the amount stored when the payment was made (string as-is, a null or missing stored field uses the spot rate). Top-level notes tagged `#21GiftsShop` show a `#Shop` pill (`forum.shopTag` → `/shops`) and hide the raw token. Posts show React (`forum.react`) and do not show Gift / Send Bitcoin. Nested replies show Gift pay (`forum.pay` = “Send Bitcoin”) when `payable`. Load error is `role="alert"` `text-app-danger` + labeled **Try again**. Footer `gap-5`. A moderator sees **Edit shop note** after copy on a top-level shop note, then icon-only Trash2 + inline confirm.
- `IntroduceYourselfOverlay` (scrim `bg-app-overlay`, Card panel, IconButton close, labeled `Button` CTA) when setup is complete and the member has not posted. No other screen shows it.
- `RequirementsOverlay` (same overlay chrome, no Skip) when a post is missing a name, username, or rules agreement, or explains the missing wallet.
- `ExternalLinkWarning` (same overlay chrome, no Skip) when a visitor clicks an external http(s) URL in note, About me, or inbox text. Internal 21.gifts URLs navigate in-app with no overlay.

Author names with `accountId` open `/members/[accountId]`.

Handbook states: loans-collecting, loans-due, loans-behind, loans-nothing-due, loans-sunday, loans-multi, loans-multi-open, menu-loan-due, menu-loan-behind, repay-today, writer, writer-ask, writer-validation-error, writer-place-open, wallet-buttons, wallet-buttons-slim, reaction-open, place, place-coords, composer-place, composer-place-map, composer-place-pending, composer-place-confirm, composer-place-unlabeled, composer-place-set, composer-place-set-coords, shop-edit, shop-edit-open, shop-edit-place, shop-edit-text, shop-edit-user, shop-edit-summary.

### `/wallet`

Fill `AppShell` (page frame); `topLeft={<WalletChromeLeft />}`; the Back on screen is `WalletScreenView`'s `ProfileChromeLeft` via `AppShellTopLeft`. `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="wallet"`. The page has three in-page views: home, Send, and Receive. Each carries an `sr-only` **h1** **Wallet**. Back closes the current in-page step first: in Send an open send step (while a confirm send is in flight, or while pasted text is read, it keeps the step instead), then Send or Receive back to home; from home it returns to the previous in-app view or `/welcome` when this tab has none. These views are steps of one page, not a second back control.

**Home.** One `Card surface={false}` holding, when the in-app wallet is configured and the account can produce a phrase (`walletRequired` with a `passkeyCredentialId`), the balance in a centred `min-h-48` box: `<section aria-label={t('wallet.balanceHeading')}>` (region **Balance**), first a label `<p>` with the same classes as `profile.giftsHeading` (`text-center text-xs tracking-widest text-app-subtle uppercase`). `connecting`: `Loader2` `h-8 w-8 animate-spin text-app-subtle` then `<p role="status">` `wallet.connecting`. `ready`: the Bitcoin balance as the large figure (`text-5xl sm:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight tabular-nums lining-nums`). When the default fiat has a usable rate the figure sits in a plain `<button>` (`rounded-3xl px-4 py-2 hover:bg-app-hover`) with the fiat amount under it (`text-base text-app-muted tabular-nums`); a tap swaps which of the two is large (Money rule: both always show once a rate is loaded). Without a usable rate only the Bitcoin figure shows and nothing can be tapped. `error`: `<p role="alert" className="text-center text-sm text-app-danger">` `wallet.balanceError` then labeled **Try again** (`login.retry`). When background setup gives up, `setupFailed` shows `WalletSetupNote` with `walletSetup.error` and a secondary **Try again** (`login.retry`). These states sit in the same central box. The block renders nothing, and the box is omitted, when the wallet is not configured or the account cannot produce a phrase. While the wallet is `ready`, `LoansCard place="wallet"` follows in a `-mt-2 w-full max-w-xl` wrapper, then the **Payments** card (below). `WalletFooterActions` (shared with the forum home) registers in `AppShellFooter`: an `aria-hidden` `pointer-events-none` 18px fade above it (`absolute -inset-x-5 bottom-full h-[18px] bg-gradient-to-t from-app-card to-transparent backdrop-blur-[1.5px]`, masked to fade out), then a `max-w-sm` two-column grid (`data-footer-actions`, `pt-2` at full size) of equal labeled `Button size="lg"` (`min-h-14 text-base` at full size), **Receive** on the left (`wallet.receive`, `ArrowDownRight` icon pointing in) and **Send** on the right (`wallet.sendButton`, `ArrowUpRight` icon), both always enabled, also while the wallet opens (**Wait only where the wallet is needed**, under Send). Below 360px the icons hide and the buttons are `px-2`. Nothing sits under the grid. The buttons follow the scroll (here and on `/welcome`): `--footer-collapse` on the frame body goes from 0 (full) to 1 (slim: 36 px, `0.875rem` text, 16 px icons, grid `pt` `0.25rem`, footer bottom padding `0.75rem` instead of `1.25rem`) over about 80 px of scrolling down and back over about 80 px up, with no transition while the page moves; within 24 px of the top it is 0. After 140 ms without scrolling an in-between value glides (`data-footer-snap`, 320 ms `ease-glide`) to the nearer end; reduced motion goes there at once. Every size is a `calc` on that property, so at rest the classes equal the full size. The recovery-phrase entry is on `/settings`; the 12 words and recovery errors are only on `/wallet/phrase`.

**Receive.** `Card surface={false}`: the label `<p>` **Receive** (`wallet.receive`, balance-label classes), the Open CryptoPay `QrCode` (`profile.giftsQr`, `profileQrLogo`), the `profile.giftsHeading` label, the address (`font-mono text-sm`, truncated), a labeled `Button variant="secondary"` **Copy** (`wallet.copy`, `Copy` icon) that writes the address to the clipboard and turns into **Copied** (`wallet.copied`, `Check` icon) for two seconds, then content-width **Set an amount** (`ButtonLink` to `/pos`). Without a username: **Set a username first.** linking to `/profile`.

**Send.** **Send** opens this view at once, whatever the wallet status; it also stays, whatever view was chosen, while a send is in flight, its Sent line shows, or a send alert is up, and it never closes because the wallet is not ready. **Wait only where the wallet is needed.** Opening Send, the camera, **Paste**, **Enter manually**, a Lightning address or LNURL on another host (read through the api), a 21.gifts shop's open charge, and the amount step never wait for the wallet. Only the SDK read of a text and the prepare that gives the fee need it. A text the wallet reads, submitted while the wallet opens, keeps the camera off: the white `Loader2` in the middle gets `<p role="status">` `wallet.connecting` under it (`text-lg font-medium text-white`), both pills stay disabled, and the text is read on its own once the wallet is open. A payment whose fee is not known yet shows the `quote` step: the confirm layout (large amount with fiat, **To {recipient}**) with a `Loader2` `h-6 w-6 text-app-subtle` and `<p role="status">` `wallet.connecting` where the fee goes, the footer **Send** disabled without a spinner, and **Cancel** enabled; the fee and an enabled **Send** follow on their own. When the wallet could not be opened, the input step shows `wallet.balanceError` in the alert slot over the camera with an overlay **Try again** (`login.retry`), and the `quote` step shows `<p role="alert">` `wallet.balanceError` with a secondary **Try again** (`wallet.payRetry`) in place of the spinner; both open the wallet again (or run the setup again) and keep the text and the step. An account without a wallet it can use here gets the input alert `wallet.payUnavailable` once a step needs the wallet. The top-left arrow on an input step that waits for the wallet drops that text and returns home. `Card surface={false}` (`WalletPanelView`) with `WalletSend`: `<section aria-label={t('wallet.sendHeading')}>` (region **Send Bitcoin**) with the same label `<p>` as the balance. Input: a full-size camera. A black layer marked `data-port-fill` (`absolute inset-0 overflow-hidden rounded-b-[calc(1.5rem-1px)]`) fills the visible page port edge to edge, between the header row and the bottom of the frame; `globals.css` makes the scrollport its containing block (`position: relative`) only while such a layer is in the page, and the view opens at scroll top. The **Send Bitcoin** label is not shown then. Inside, `QrScanner` (`<section aria-label={t('wallet.scanHint')}>`, `absolute inset-0 bg-black [container-type:size]`): an `absolute inset-0` `object-cover` `<video>` (`playsInline muted`, rear camera preferred), an `aria-hidden` `pointer-events-none` viewfinder (`size-[68cqmin]`, centred, `border-2 border-white/80 rounded-3xl`, four `border-white` 6px corner marks, the rest dimmed by a `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.35)` spread shadow), and the line `wallet.scanHint` over the top (`text-lg sm:text-xl font-medium text-white` on a `from-black/80` gradient). A blocked camera puts `<p role="alert">` `wallet.cameraDenied` in white a third of the way down (no camera: `wallet.cameraUnavailable`). Over the lower part float two `Button variant="overlay"` pills (`min-h-12 text-base`, `bottom-6`, `flex-wrap` so they stack at 320px): **Paste** (`wallet.sendPaste`, lucide `ClipboardPaste`) reads `navigator.clipboard.readText()` and takes the text like a scan; a refusal shows `wallet.pasteDenied`, an empty clipboard `wallet.pasteEmpty`, as a small `role="alert"` `bg-black/55 backdrop-blur-md` pill above the buttons for four seconds while the camera keeps running. **Enter manually** (`wallet.sendEnterManually`, lucide `Keyboard`) opens a bottom sheet over the camera (`absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 rounded-t-2xl bg-app-card p-4 pt-12 shadow-lg`) with the step Close (`IconButton` `X`, `wallet.sendCancel`) in an `absolute left-3 top-3` wrapper, the focused `Field` **Payment request or address**, alerts `role="alert"` `text-app-danger` under it, and **Continue**; Close or the top-left arrow returns to the camera. While the text is read a white `Loader2` (`h-10 w-10`) spins in the middle and both pills are disabled. An input alert without the sheet shows in `text-lg font-medium text-white` a third of the way down with an overlay **Try again** (`login.retry`) under it, which clears the alert and restarts the camera. A text that cannot be read always ends in one such alert: parse failures as before, `wallet.sendUnreadable` after an unexpected error. The camera runs only while the input step is idle, shows no alert, and the sheet is closed; it stops on a scan, a paste, **Continue**, the next step, Back, and when the view closes. The amount step sits in an inner `rounded-xl border border-app-border bg-app-card p-3 pt-12` box with the step Close (`IconButton` `X`, aria `wallet.sendCancel` **Cancel**) in an `absolute left-3 top-3` wrapper, like the pay sheet; it is a dismiss on this view, not a back control, and the top-left arrow closes the step too. The confirm and sent steps have no box. While a confirm send is in flight, the arrow keeps the confirm step and its **Cancel** is disabled. Amount: **To {recipient}**, `AmountEntry` (`wallet.sendAmountLabel`), for a Lightning address or LNURL receiver (read by the wallet or, on another host, through the api) the bounds line `wallet.sendAmountRange` (each bound `formatBitcoin` plus `·` and the preferred fiat when a rate is loaded) and, when the receiver takes one, an optional `Field` **Message (optional)** with its `maxLength`; when the receiver refused the message as too long (an outside address read through the api), the alert `wallet.sendCommentLong` (`role="alert"` `text-app-danger`) follows that field; then **Continue**. An amount outside the bounds, or none, shows the alert `wallet.sendAmountInvalid` with the same bounds; for a request or address without receiver bounds the alert is `wallet.sendAmountMin` (at least ₿1, with fiat; for a base-chain address at least the minimum the SDK named, once it refused a smaller amount). A base-chain address has neither the bounds line nor the message field. Confirm, laid out like home: the amount as `formatBitcoin` in the home balance type (`text-5xl sm:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight tabular-nums lining-nums`), centred, with the preferred fiat under it (`text-base text-app-muted tabular-nums`) when a rate is loaded; then **To {recipient}** (`text-sm text-app-muted truncate`) and **Fee {amount}** (`text-xs` muted, the preferred-fiat suffix only when the fee is above ₿0). `AppShellFooter` holds a `max-w-sm` column: one labeled `Button size="lg"` (`min-h-14 text-base`) **Send** (`wallet.sendButton`; `Loader2` spinner and disabled while sending), then a small underlined muted text button **Cancel** (`wallet.sendCancel`, `text-sm`; disabled while sending), which closes the step like the amount step's Close. Sent: `CircleCheck` `h-16 w-16 text-app-success`, then `<div role="status">` holding **Sent {amount}** (`wallet.sendSent`) in the same large type with the preferred fiat under it, then **To {recipient}** (the confirmed recipient, `text-sm text-app-muted truncate`), and in `AppShellFooter` one labeled `Button size="lg"` (`min-h-14 text-base`) **Done** (`wallet.sendDone`), which returns home. Copy says Bitcoin, payment request, and address only.

**Send to a Bitcoin address.** A base-chain address keeps the confirm layout above (large amount, fiat, **To {recipient}** with the address cut short, the same footer) and, because its network fee is much higher than the fee of other payments, never hides that fee. Between **To** and the footer: when an expired quote was renewed, `<p role="alert">` `wallet.sendQuoteRenewed` (`text-sm text-app-danger`); then **Fee {amount}** (`wallet.payFee`) and **Total {amount}** (`wallet.sendTotal`, amount plus fee), each with the preferred-fiat suffix, in `text-base font-semibold text-app-fg` (not the `text-xs` muted fee line of other payments), directly under the recipient so they never sit under the footer (the step column is `gap-3 py-2`); then `<div role="group" aria-label={t('wallet.sendSpeedLabel')}>` (`max-w-sm`, full width) with the kicker `wallet.sendSpeedLabel` in the same classes as the view label and one labeled row per speed, fastest first (`wallet.sendSpeedFast`, `wallet.sendSpeedMedium`, `wallet.sendSpeedSlow`): a `type="button"` with `aria-pressed`, `min-h-11 rounded-xl border px-4 py-2 text-sm`, the name left and the fee right on one line (`formatBitcoin` plus the preferred-fiat suffix); the pressed row has `border-app-accent bg-app-card-muted font-semibold`, the others `border-app-border`. A row whose fee the balance does not cover is disabled (`opacity-50`) and adds `wallet.sendSpeedUncovered` in `text-xs text-app-danger`; every row is disabled while sending. Then `wallet.sendOnchainFeeHint` in `text-xs text-app-muted`.

While the wallet is `ready`, the optional loans card sits between the balance and a **Payments** card (`Card surface={false}`) on home: `<section aria-label={t('wallet.historyHeading')}>` with an **h2** label in the same classes as `wallet.balanceHeading`, then a list of rows, each one `next/link` (`rounded-2xl border border-app-border bg-app-card-muted px-4 py-3 hover:bg-app-hover`) to `/wallet/payment?id=…` with a trailing `ChevronRight` (`text-app-subtle`): a decorative `ArrowDownLeft` (received) or `ArrowUpRight` (sent) icon; the title (`paymentTitle`, `text-sm font-medium`, truncated) and the amount signed `+` / `−` (`formatBitcoin`, `tabular-nums`; failed `text-app-subtle line-through`); a second line in `text-xs text-app-subtle` with the `<time>`, `·` `wallet.pending` / `wallet.failed` (failed in `text-app-danger`) when not settled, and `preferredFiatSuffix` on the right (Money rule); and a third line with the message (`paymentMessage`) in `text-sm text-app-muted`, truncated. Empty: `wallet.historyEmpty`. Error: `role="alert"` `text-app-danger` `wallet.historyError` and **Try again**. No control loads more: the next page loads when the end of the list is in view, checked again after every completed load. One-time wallet setup runs in the background. While it is due, the balance stays connecting and payment preparation waits; after its quiet retries give up, `WalletSetupNote` shows `walletSetup.error` with a secondary **Try again** (`login.retry`). It never blocks the page with a dialog.

Handbook states: default (home without a configured wallet), balance-locked (the login card in place of the wallet), balance-locked-prf-unsupported (the login card with the no-PRF alert), balance-locked-error (the login card with the wallet-open error), balance-connecting, balance-ready, loans, balance-ready-no-rate, balance-fiat (after a tap on the balance), balance-error, setup-failed (the setup note), setup-pending (**Receive** and **Send** enabled while the background setup is due), receive, receive-copied, receive-no-username, receive-opening (the Receive view while the setup has not registered the address), receive-setup-failed (the Receive view with the setup note), send-input (camera live, stubbed in the test browser), send-manual (after **Enter manually**), send-manual-alert (an input alert under the field), send-manual-busy (while the typed text is read), send-paste-denied (after **Paste** with a refused clipboard), send-paste-empty (after **Paste** with an empty clipboard), send-camera-denied, send-camera-unavailable, send-amount, send-amount-fiat, send-amount-error, send-amount-request, send-amount-no-comment, send-amount-min, send-confirm, send-confirm-sending, send-confirm-fixed, send-confirm-shop, send-confirm-member, send-input-busy, send-amount-busy, send-sent, send-amount-onchain, send-amount-onchain-min, send-confirm-onchain, send-confirm-onchain-fast (after pressing **Fast**), send-confirm-onchain-slow (after pressing **Slow**), send-confirm-onchain-low, send-confirm-onchain-renewed, send-confirm-onchain-renewing (after **Send** found the quote expired, while the new one is asked for), send-confirm-onchain-sending, send-unsupported, send-invalid, send-failed, send-insufficient, send-error, send-not-payable, send-not-found, send-relay-unreachable, send-unavailable, send-unreadable, send-input-opening (a read that waits for the wallet), send-input-wallet-error (that read after the wallet could not be opened), send-confirm-opening (the `quote` step), send-confirm-wallet-error (the `quote` step after the wallet could not be opened), send-comment-long, history-empty, history-rows, history-error. Phrase, error, timeout, and prf-unsupported are `/wallet/phrase`.

### `/wallet/payment`

Fill `AppShell` like `/wallet`: `topLeft={<WalletChromeLeft />}` (the one arrow: the previous in-app view, the list when opened from it, or `/welcome` when this tab has none), `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`, `OnboardingGate screen="wallet"`, `Suspense` around `WalletPaymentDetails` (`useSearchParams`). `Card surface={false}` with an `sr-only` **h1** **Payment** (`wallet.payment.heading`) and a `flex-col gap-5` column. Head, centred: the direction icon in an `h-12 w-12` round `bg-app-card-muted` badge, the title (`paymentTitle`, `text-sm text-app-muted`, truncated), the signed amount (`text-3xl font-semibold tabular-nums lining-nums`; failed `text-app-subtle line-through`), the default fiat under it (`text-sm text-app-muted`; absent only without a usable rate), then a status pill (`rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-xs font-medium`: **Completed** `bg-app-success/10 text-app-success`, **Pending** `bg-app-notice text-app-notice-fg`, **Failed** `bg-app-danger/10 text-app-danger`), and for a pending or failed send one `text-xs text-app-muted` hint line (`wallet.payment.pendingHint`, `wallet.payment.failedHint`). The message (`paymentMessage`) sits in a `rounded-2xl bg-app-card-muted px-4 py-3` box with the `wallet.payment.message` label. Summary: a `dl` `divide-y divide-app-border rounded-2xl border border-app-border px-4`, rows `dt` `text-sm text-app-muted` left and `dd` `text-sm` right: Date (`Intl.DateTimeFormat` long date, short time), Type, To, Description (only when not already the title), Amount, Fee (`wallet.payment.feeFree` at ₿0; hidden for a fee-less receive and a failed payment), Total (sends with a fee, `font-medium`), Arrived on-chain (deposits with a claim fee). Every ₿ figure is `formatBitcoin` plus `preferredFiatSuffix` (Money rule). Details: an `h2` label in the balance-label classes (`wallet.payment.technical`) over a second bordered `dl` whose values are `font-mono text-xs`, shortened to 10 + `…` + 6 characters, each with an icon-only ghost `IconButton` Copy (`wallet.payment.copyValue`; `Check` in `text-app-success` and a polite `sr-only` **Copied** for two seconds). An on-chain payment adds an underlined muted `wallet.payment.viewTx` link with `ExternalLink`; a click opens `ExternalLinkWarning` first, and only its confirm opens `https://mempool.space/tx/<txid>` (`openInSystemBrowser`). Missing: `role="alert"` `text-sm text-app-muted` `wallet.payment.missing`. Load error (any other failed read): `role="alert"` `text-sm text-app-danger` `wallet.payment.error`, then a labeled `Button` **Try again** (`login.retry`) that calls `retry`. The view renders only once the payment and the rate (`useSpotRateState`) have loaded. No key, `npub`, note id, or zap wording appears: a zap is titled `wallet.payment.giftOnPost`, and the invoice row is `wallet.payment.invoice` **Payment request**.

Handbook states: default (a received zap), address-send, spark-send (a wallet transfer, Fee Free), pending, failed, deposit, withdraw, missing, load-error (a failed read with **Try again**), copied (after Copy), external-link (after View on mempool.space), loading, locked (the login card in place of payment details, pinned by `?visual=balance-locked`), connecting, error, prf-unsupported (the same login card with the no-PRF alert, pinned by `?visual=balance-locked-prf-unsupported`), locked-error (the same login card with the wallet-open error, pinned by `?visual=balance-locked-error`), setup-failed (the setup note, pinned by `?visual=balance-setup-failed`).

### `/loans/repay`

Fill `AppShell`; `WalletChromeLeft` supplies the single top-left history arrow and `SignedInChrome` supplies **Menu**. `OnboardingGate screen="wallet"` wraps `LoanRepayScreen`, whose body is `mx-auto flex w-full max-w-xl flex-col gap-4 px-1 pb-8`. There is only an `sr-only` h1 **Loan repayment**.

The first visible box is always the applicable status. Ordinary due is `w-full rounded-2xl border bg-app-card-muted p-4`, with `border-app-danger/50` only when behind. The heading is `text-sm font-semibold`; behind uses `text-app-danger`. The main amount is `text-3xl font-semibold tabular-nums lining-nums`; Bitcoin-first states put preferred fiat on the next `text-sm text-app-muted` line, while a common defined fiat puts `{fiat} · ₿` together in the large line and a different preferred fiat below. The people/loan count is muted. Waiting shares use `mt-3 flex gap-2 rounded-xl bg-app-notice px-3 py-2 text-sm text-app-notice-fg` with `AlertTriangle text-app-accent`, never danger red. **Who gets paid** is a full-width `min-h-11` disclosure; its open list uses divided `text-sm` rows, uppercase muted loan labels when grouped, tabular amounts, and `-mx-2 rounded-lg bg-app-notice px-2` for **No wallet yet · waits**.

The pay area is a centred `mt-4 flex flex-col gap-3`. Connecting uses `Loader2 h-4 w-4` with the muted **Checking your wallet…** status; exhausted background setup uses `WalletSetupNote`. Ready balance is `text-xs text-app-muted` above `Button size="lg"`; **Send** is the only confirmation. Sending uses the same spinner anatomy plus a muted status. Short balance is an inner `rounded-xl border border-app-border bg-app-card p-3`: semibold title, muted tabular detail, then `Button size="lg"` **Top up your wallet**. Open, it centers `WalletOwnAddress` (address, non-inverted profile QR, labeled secondary **Copy**) and the muted spinner line **Waiting for your top-up…**. The prefix action below is an underlined `text-sm font-medium` button. Failed is `text-app-danger`; unconfirmed is muted. A normal result, nothing-due state, and final-payment state use `border-app-success/50`; success headings combine `Check` with `text-app-success`, followed by a muted fee row only when the fee is nonzero. Sunday uses the neutral due-box anatomy.

The loan list is `flex flex-col gap-3`, introduced by the uppercase muted **Your loan(s)** label. Multiple entries add `rounded-xl border border-app-border p-3`; each has a two-line-clamped semibold text, muted tabular plan, then a `text-xs` row for **Repaid …** and **Day n of N** over an 8px SVG bar (`fill-app-border` track, `fill-app-success` progress). Collecting replaces the bar with muted **Not fully funded yet.** **Repayment list** is an underlined `text-xs font-medium` link. Empty and load-error states stay in the same `max-w-xl` column; load error uses `text-app-danger` plus secondary **Try again**.

Handbook states: default, who-open, unavailable, multi, multi-who-open, fiat, behind, waiting, waiting-who-open, waiting-all, short, topup, sending, partial, repaid, last-due, last, last-multi, nothing-due, sunday, unconfirmed, failed, collecting, none, load-error.

### `/welcome` wallet footer and views

A signed-in member with a configured wallet gets the same `WalletFooterActions` as `/wallet` in the shell footer of the forum home. **Receive** / **Send** open `WalletPanelView` over the page from `useWalletPanel` (the hook `/wallet` uses): the welcome column stays mounted in a `hidden` wrapper, the footer is not rendered, the view starts at the top, and closing restores the feed's scroll position. The top-left arrow is the chrome back override (`useChromeBack`, label `nav.back`), the slot an ask-wizard step uses; it closes the manual-entry sheet, then an open send step, then the view. The wordmark and the Menu's **Home** close the view and return to the top of the feed, dropping a read in flight (`useWalletSend` `abandon`); a confirmed send in flight keeps the view. Signed-out visitors and members without a configured wallet see no footer. Handbook states: wallet-buttons, wallet-setup-pending (**Receive** and **Send** enabled while the background setup is due), wallet-receive, wallet-send-camera, wallet-send-camera-denied, wallet-send-manual, and `wallet-<id>` for every other `/wallet` Send and Receive state (`receive-copied`, `receive-opening`, `receive-setup-failed`, and each `send-…` variant) shown over the forum home; `receive-no-username` cannot occur there, because the forum home needs a username, and `send-unavailable` cannot either, because the forum home shows no **Send** without a wallet the account can use.

### `/settings`

Fill `AppShell`; `ProfileChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` → `SettingsScreen`: `Card surface={false}` with **h1** **Settings** (`settings.heading`, same classes as `/moderate`), then a `section` labelled by its **h2** **Wallet** (`wallet.title`, the small uppercase label classes of `wallet.balanceHeading`). With a non-empty `passkeyCredentialId`: one labeled secondary `ButtonLink size="lg"` **Recovery phrase** (`settings.recoveryPhrase`). Missing or empty id: the muted `text-sm` hint `wallet.addPhraseHint`, then a labeled primary `ButtonLink size="lg"` **Add recovery phrase** (`wallet.addPhrase`). Both open `/wallet/phrase` client-side; its top-left arrow comes back here. No passkey prompt on this page.

Handbook states: default (Recovery phrase), activate (hint and Add recovery phrase).

### `/pos`

Signed-in till. `AppShell` fill, same chrome as `/profile`. `OnboardingGate screen="profile"`. `Card` `surface={false}`: **h1** `pos.title`, the public `username@21.gifts` row, and the same Open CryptoPay QR as the member card (`profileQrLogo` centered), including on a smartphone. **Set an amount** opens `/pos/amount` when nothing is open. That page is only the keypad and **Create payment**. While a charge is open, `/pos` shows remaining `m:ss`, the amount in ₿ and fiat, and **Cancel**, and asks `GET /pos/charge` every three seconds whether it is paid, also at 0:00 and for one minute after the charge ran out. Cancel stops asking. A paid charge replaces that block with **Paid ✓**, the amount in ₿ and fiat, and **New payment**. A missing username links to `/profile`; a username without a verified wallet shows `pos.needWallet` linking to `/wallet` while setup remains pending. While setup is due or has failed, the address and QR are hidden because the address is not registered; after failure `WalletSetupNote` replaces the link. Once the till has loaded, a **History** section (`PosHistory`) closes the card with the existing newest-first paid/expired/cancelled rows and no paging control.

Handbook states: default, open, paid, history, loading, error, cancel-failed, refresh-failed, need-username, need-wallet, setup-pending (address and QR hidden while the background setup is due), setup-failed.

### `/profile`

Fill `AppShell` (page frame); `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` → `Card sm` `surface={false}` → resting header when a profile photo or wide image is stored (wide image `aspect-[5/2] w-full rounded-2xl object-cover`; round photo `h-16 w-16 rounded-full object-cover`, overlapping the wide image's lower edge when both exist, otherwise centered; a missing wide image or profile photo is the button **Add a wide image** or **Add a profile photo**; neither is the About me photo) → **h1** Profile → `AccountActivityChart` has no FiatPicker (signed-in); empty = `profile.chartEmpty`, no SVG; populated ₿ | selected fiat `tone="gift"` → About me (`AboutMeSection` owner: empty prompt + **Write your About me**, or filled text + pencil; Languages **Translate** on the filled read-only text when `aboutMessageId` is set; the editor has no control; copy-profile-link on the card — never a forum post) → Name overline + value + edit `IconButton` → Location overline + value or `location.unset` + edit/clear `IconButton` (pencil / check / X / trash) → the same public facts as the member card (`MemberProfileScreen` `factsOnly`: role pill, funding-program icon (press reveals the sentence; screenshot state `funding-program-press`), `username@21.gifts`, pay QR, Shop sticker, Posts/Reactions, activity feed; no Message, no staff actions) → `PushToggle` (Notifications heading, first pill All/Active/Mentions plus muted hint, second pill This device On/Off when Push APIs are ready; selected fill `bg-app-btn`; On/Off text so color is not the only encoding) → `LanguagePreferenceSwitcher` (overline + `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` English / Deutsch / Español / Filipino, one-row `rounded-full` like Theme) → `ThemeSwitcher` (overline + `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` System / Light / Dark) → `FiatPreferenceSwitcher` (overline + `FiatPicker` `tone="neutral"` CHF|EUR|USD|PHP) → `NumberFormatSwitcher` last (overline + `SegmentedControl tone="neutral"` with samples `10'000.23` / `10,000.23` / `23.000,33`). Given/Received labels stay.

### `/grants`

Fill `AppShell`; `ProfileChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` → `GrantsScreen`: `FundingStatusCard` with one **h1** **21 gifts grant** (app page ramp, no hairline). Apply is not a ButtonLink except for a verified account named `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas` with status none or rejected, who still see Apply and can open the walk. A basis account sees You are not verified yet and no Apply. Pending, trial, and admitted keep their status copy for every verified username. Every other verified account with status none or rejected shows the paused sentence and `https://21.gifts/statistics`. A secondary **Goals** `ButtonLink` to `/grants/goals` when the account is non-null. Two secondary `size="lg"` `ButtonLink`s, **Daily payment text** (`/grants/payments/comment`) and **Daily payment amounts** (`/grants/payments/amounts`), render only when `canEditDailyPayoutRoster`. Neither link fetches the roster. Plus, for an account at least moderator (`roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')`), including an initiator and a founder, a secondary **Open application (1)** or **Open applications (N)** `ButtonLink` (`funding.applications.openCount`) to `/grants/applications`. Menu row **Grants** (`nav.grants`, lucide `HandCoins`, `/grants`) is after Profile and before Settings for every signed-in account.

Handbook states: not-verified, pending, trial, admitted, funding-program-open, open-applications, daily-payments.

### `/grants/goals`

Fill `AppShell`; `ProfileChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` → `Card` `maxWidth="xl"` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Goals**. The grant program continues at 10 active shops. A shop is active with at least one transaction on 5 of the last 7 days. A transaction is a till payment the assigned member created at https://21.gifts/pos that UTC day; creating it counts, including later expiry or cancel. The measurement panel reuses the statistics chart shell: how many shops meet the rule, **Shops per UTC day**, `ShopActivityChart` for those 7 UTC days (lighter bar is today, still open), or **Loading…**, or the error sentence plus **Try again**. It calls `GET /funding/goal`, not `GET /shops/activity`. Signed-in members open it from **Goals** on `/grants`. No session renders nothing and does not fetch.

Handbook states: default, loading, error.

### `/grants/apply`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `ProfileChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}`. The paused card **h1** is **21 gifts grant** (`funding.heading`). The apply walk **h1** is **Apply for the 21 gifts grant** (`funding.apply.heading`). A basis account named `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, or `jewel-bacolbas` sees that walk heading and then You are not verified yet, and does not post. Any other basis account whose status is not pending, trial, or admitted sees the paused card. A basis account with status pending, trial, or admitted sees You are not verified yet and does not post. Verified usernames `joey-rosima`, `vincent`, and `jewel-bacolbas` with status none or rejected still see and complete the apply walk (About me, photo, location, questions, POST). Pending, trial, and admitted keep their copy for every verified username. A missing account, and a verified account with status none or rejected whose username is not one of those three, sees the paused sentence and `https://21.gifts/statistics` and does not start the walk. There is no in-card back. The top-left arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. `/profile/apply` redirects here.

Handbook states: default, about, sunday, photo, location, question, truth, translate, translate-loading, translate-done, translate-hidden, translate-error, forbidden, pending, trial, admitted, empty-posts, loading, error, applying, apply-failed, unmet.

### `/grants/payments/comment`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` is the only back, `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Daily payment text**. An initiator or founder sees the stored comment. Everyone else who is signed in sees **You cannot change daily payments.** There is no in-card back. The comment is text, with an icon-only pencil (`aria-label` **Edit comment**) on the same line, to the right of the text. The pencil opens the field. Save is an icon-only check (`aria-label` **Save**, primary) and cancel is an icon-only X (`aria-label` **Cancel**). Those words are not shown. A save in flight replaces the check with a spinner. An empty comment shows **Not set**. This page has no default-amount sentence, no payments switch, no recipients, and no **Add**.

Handbook states: default, empty, loading, error, forbidden, invalid, save-error, pending, editing.

### `/grants/payments/amounts`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` is the only back, `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Daily payment amounts**. An initiator or founder sees the amount editor. Everyone else who is signed in sees **You cannot change daily payments.** There is no in-card back. Under the heading, one sentence says everyone in the grant program receives the roster `defaultAmountUsd` by default (`formatUsdDisplay`, not a fixed figure in the copy) and that this page is only for entering a different amount by hand. Someone who should receive the default does not need to be listed. Each recipient row shows the display name, or Unnamed when the name is null or blank, the formatted USD amount, an icon-only pencil (**Edit** plus the shown name), and an icon-only trash (**Delete** plus the shown name) on one line. The name is a profile link only when `accountId` is set. No address is typed or shown. The add form's first field is Person. The pencil opens a `Field` for that amount; the check saves and the X cancels. **On**, **Off**, **Add**, and **Try again** stay labeled buttons. The comment is not on this page.

Handbook states: default, empty, loading, error, forbidden, invalid, off, invalid-switch, duplicate, unknown, save-error, pending, editing, suggest, chosen, pick-person, invalid-person, unknown-person, no-lightning.

### `/profile/apply`

Redirects to `/grants/apply`.

### `/members/[accountId]`

Fill `AppShell` (page frame); `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` → `MemberProfileLoader` → identity `Card` `surface={false}` (**h1** `profile.title`, chart, About me inside the card — not a forum post; copy-profile-link inside About me — optional Message, name, location (read-only; `location.unset` when empty), public `username@21.gifts`, optional role pill, optional funding-program icon-only button (pressing it reveals that one sentence; that result is the separate screenshot state `funding-program-open`) when `fundingReviewedAt` is a number, activity **Posts** / **Reactions** as labeled `Button sm` toggles, staff **Verify** as a link to `/members/[accountId]/verify` (not an inline question), plus Propose / Confirm / Appoint via `MemberTrustActions` behind the closed **Moderator functions** disclosure when the viewer is staff and the subject is someone else) + on-demand post/reply feeds. Own profiles use this route too (forum author names navigate here, not `/profile`). The identity card has no edit. A moderator can edit a shop note in the posts feed. Back is icon-only like profile. Feed posts/replies keep **Translate** via `NoteTranslate`. Filled read-only About me also keeps Languages **Translate** when `profileMessage.id` is set. `RequirementsOverlay` (scrim `bg-app-overlay`, Card panel, IconButton close, no Skip) when a reply is missing a requirement. When a username is set, a centered `QrCode` (label `profile.giftsQr`) under the address encodes `openCryptoPayQrValue` (`https://<domain>/pl/?lightning=` plus the uppercase LNURL of `https://<domain>/.well-known/lnurlp/<local>`), including on a smartphone. A missing username shows no QR. Under the QR a labeled `Button size="sm" variant="secondary"` **Shop sticker** opens `ShopStickerOverlay`, including on a smartphone (the preview is a payment QR).
Handbook states: default (About me when set), `note-null`, missing (`view.missing`), error + labeled **Try again**, own, `overlay-wallet` (posts feed open, listed note expanded, Amount filled, Post → `RequirementsOverlay` **Your wallet is not set up**, no form, no Skip, labeled **Open your wallet** → `/wallet`), `staff-verify`, `staff-verify-open`, `funding-reviewed`, `funding-program-open`, `sticker-open`, `sticker-busy`, `sticker-failed`, `shop-edit`, `shop-edit-open`, `shop-edit-place`, `shop-edit-text`, `shop-edit-user`, `shop-edit-summary`, `translate*` (German post in the posts feed). Overlay-wallet is reachable from a posts-feed reply; About me is not a replyable forum note.

### `/members/[accountId]/verify`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` is the only back, `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="profile"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Verify**. There is no in-card back. A moderator who is not the subject, and a basis member with a stored name, sees that exact name as an underlined link to the member card, the question under it, then **Yes** and **No**. **Yes** posts the untrimmed stored name and then opens `/members/[accountId]`. **No** opens the member card and does not post. Sunday hides both buttons. There is no Cancel. Chrome back does not post.

Handbook states: default, unnamed, loading, error, missing, forbidden, sunday, failed, deciding.

### `/notifications`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `NotificationsLoader` → `NotificationsScreen`: **h1** **Notifications** (`h1` ramp), then unread rows under an `h2` **Unread** and already-seen rows under an `h2` **Already seen** (both **section** ramp, not centered; an empty group is omitted; each list keeps fetch order). Rows are posts, replies, payments, and hearts (`{name} posted` / `{name} replied` / `{name} sent bitcoin` / `{name} sent you a heart`, post text or `notifications.photoPost` (**Photo**), reply text or `notifications.photoOnly` (**Photo reaction**), zap amount as stored, time). Unread semibold / read muted. Empty `notifications.empty`. Loading. Error + labeled **Try again**. Click a reply or mention row → `/messages/{replyId}`. Click a post, payment, or heart row → `/messages/{parentId}`. Ids are URI-encoded. No composer.

Handbook states: default list, empty, loading, error.

### `/moderate`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Moderation** (`h1` ramp). Staff (moderator) see a labeled **Goals** `ButtonLink` (`variant="secondary"` `size="lg"`) → `/grants/goals` (first tool), a labeled **Hidden notes** `ButtonLink` → `/moderate/hidden`, a labeled **Open proposals** `ButtonLink` → `/moderate/proposals`, **Moderators chat group** `ButtonLink` → `/moderate/group`, **Handbook** `ButtonLink` → `/moderate/handbook`, and **Show payout per person** `ButtonLink` → `/moderate/payouts` (last tool). There is no payout-goal widget. Non-staff signed-in visitors see the heading plus forbidden copy and no tools list. Menu row **Moderation** (`nav.moderate`, lucide `Shield`, `/moderate`) only when `roleAtLeast(role, 'moderator')`, after Statistics. This page does not fetch `GET /gifts/stats` or the hidden list. No un-hide control.

Handbook states: default hub, group-unread, proposals-unread, forbidden.

### `/grants/applications`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` returns to the previous in-app view or `/welcome`, `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Open applications**. There is no in-card back. Staff list pending grant applications (name → `/grants/applications/{id}`, applied time). Empty / Loading… / error+Try again. Non-staff: heading + forbidden copy, no list. `/moderate/applications` redirects here.

Handbook states: default, forbidden, empty, loading, error.

### `/grants/applications/[accountId]`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` returns to the previous in-app view or `/welcome`, `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Grant application**. There is no in-card back. Staff see two questions and the living-room posts (Languages **Translate** on the post text; the applicant name stays plain; each post keeps its own time; no application time under the name). The first asks whether their profile posts match the core principles of 21.gifts and links to `/about`. **Yes** opens the truth question. **Yes** there admits and **No** on either question rejects; both decisions return to `/grants/applications`. Failed decision uses `trustChain.actionFailed`. Non-staff: heading + forbidden copy. `/moderate/applications/[accountId]` redirects here.

Handbook states: default, truth, forbidden, empty, loading, error, decide-failed, deciding.

### `/moderate/hidden`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` returns to the previous in-app view or `/welcome`, `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Hidden notes** (`h1` ramp) → lead (soft hide of the note and its untagged direct replies; not a hard delete). There is no in-card back. Staff (moderator) list newest-hidden first (author name and time are the link; note text and Languages **Translate** sit outside that link, **Hidden by {name}** / **Unnamed**, created and hidden times); a row with a `via` value shows the non-interactive **External** badge next to the author name. Empty `moderate.empty`. Loading. Error + labeled **Try again**. Non-staff signed-in visitors see the heading plus forbidden copy and no list. No un-hide control. No hidden photo/video fetch.

Handbook states: default list, forbidden, empty, loading, error, external.

### `/moderate/group`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` returns to the previous in-app view or `/welcome` and is the only back control; `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → founders and moderators get `InboxScreen` as one open thread (`Card xl` `surface={false}`, `showFilter` false, `showAmount` false, `showAttach` true): **h1** **Moderators chat group** from `moderate.groupLabel` (never the api row name) + origin caption + **Inbox thread bubbles** (stills + quoted-note unfurl) + composer with **Add a photo** (JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 10, photo-only send) and icon send. Typing `@` opens the People list; choosing a person inserts `@username ` and does not notify them. A stored `@username` in a bubble is the profile button (`mention`). Direct/Contact/Damus inbox threads attach the same stills on `/messages`; this page is the closed staff room only. Other signed-in visitors see `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Moderators chat group** → `moderate.groupForbidden` and no fetch. Loading **Loading…**; error copy + **Try again**.

### `/moderate/handbook`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `topLeft={<ProfileChromeLeft />}` returns to the previous in-app view or `/welcome`, `topRight={<SignedInChrome />}`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** **Handbook** (`h1` ramp). There is no in-card back. Staff (moderator) see TOC **Chapters** and three chapters **21.gifts login** (`#login`), **Verified** (`#verified`), **Official funding program** (`#funding`), each with a permalink and a copy-link control (`HandbookCopyLink` `tone="app"`). Non-staff signed-in visitors see the heading plus forbidden copy and no chapters. No fetch.

Handbook states: default, forbidden.

### `/contact`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `ProfileChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** Contact → lead → rules link (`text-app-fg underline`) → Composer (textarea + `IconButton` Send). Alerts. Success navigates to inbox.

### `/map`

There is no map page. `/map` redirects to `/shops#map`. A query string is kept, so `/map?pin=` opens `/shops?pin=#map`.

### `/shops`

Flow `AppShell` `align="start"`; `ProfileChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` → **h1** Shops → lead `shops.lead` → **Country** select (`ShopsCountryFilter`, the full-width `ForumModeSelect`: **All countries** plus each country that has a shop as `{name} ({count})`; the choice is `?country=` in the address and narrows **Post**, **Map**, and **Table** to that country's shops) → **Post** / **Map** / **Table** `SegmentedControl` `tone="neutral"` (**Post** selected) → a closed **Add a shop** button under the pill (photos, place, text, an optional user, then summary). A moderator also sees **Edit shop note** on a shop post, on a shop pin in **Map**, and beside the name in **Table**. `/shops#map` opens **Map**, `/shops#table` opens **Table**, and `/shops#post` or a missing hash opens **Post**. There is no **Ask for money** pill and no Active / No gifts yet / All / Most popular control. The list is every top-level shop note, newest first, including notes with zero sats. Laws hint absent. Shop cards: `#Shop` pill. Listing is `GET /messages?hashtag=21GiftsShop&mode=all` (`ForumLoader feed="shops"`, `modeSelector` false). Empty `shops.empty` immediately when that page is empty. Error + Try again. On `/shops` a moderator (minimum rank) gets an icon on each shop note, **Add a place** or **Edit place** beside **Add an account** (User icon), reusing the composer map panel. Opening **Add an account** puts `@` in the field and shows the People list at once, at most eight people, with no scroller of its own. The panel is fixed to the window so the page does not scroll sideways. It stays under the app chrome and inside the window, dropping rows until it fits, and hiding the list rather than covering the chrome. Choosing a person fills `@username` and keeps the People list on that prefix (`staff-account-chosen`). A click chooses the same row as a pointer press. **Save account** still sends the name without `@`. Opening **Edit place** on a note that already has a pin shows **Remove place**. A failed save shows the error in the panel. **Map** and **Table** hide the composer. **Map** empty, loading, and error use the place-map copy. **Table** **Show more** appends the next page. An empty page that still has another page keeps **Show more** and does not use the empty sentence. A failed next page keeps the rows and offers **Try again**.

A missing-requirements response on **Table** opens `/setup/rules`, the same as the post list. **Map** with a key draws the map frame and still has no second Map heading.

### `/rules`

App shell via `RulesPageChrome`. Unsigned: one top-left arrow (`ProfileChromeLeft`, wordmark href `/`) + LanguageSwitcher. Signed-in: the same arrow (`ProfileChromeLeft`) + `SignedInChrome`. The arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. **h1-lg** Living room rules. `RulesDocument` (rule cards, Welcome/Allowed/Better not/Forbidden lists with check/x, house card, and one CTA **Contact 21.gifts** to `/contact`). There is no second back in the document. B′ overlines and ticks as in Color.

### `/habit-tracker`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `ProfileChromeLeft` + **Log in** when signed out (nothing while a session is held back), otherwise `SignedInChrome`. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` `allowGuest`. **h1** Habit-Tracker. The schedule line says each habit is daily or weekly in the time zone chosen when it was created, and a week can be rated from Monday 08:00 in that zone. People are grouped under `ownerName`. Each habit is the same note card as a living-room note: name, a Daily or Weekly chip, an Archived chip when it has a last period, the public description when set, and one row per period. Internal notes render only for the owner. A signed-out visitor uses the header **Log in** and gets no second sign-in link, no add form, rating pill, or **Send Bitcoin**. A session sees an add form (Name, Description, Internal notes, a Daily | Weekly pill, **Add habit**). On the owner's open habit every returned period is that pill. A saved rating leaves that choice pressed. An archived habit keeps its period rows and shows the Archived chip; the rating pill, Edit, and Archive are gone. A failed save keeps the list and shows the alert with **Try again** above it. A failed edit keeps that form open under the alert. A failed archive keeps the confirmation open under the alert. A failed add keeps the entered form under the alert. A failed comment keeps that draft under the alert. A failed comment deletion closes the confirmation and shows that same alert, with **Delete comment** visible again. Saving a new habit, saving an edit, posting a comment, and confirming a comment deletion each leave their own result. An initiator sees **Delete comment** before that confirm. **Edit** opens Name, Description, and Internal notes. **Save** and **Cancel** are icons; the word Save is not visible. **Archive** and **Delete comment** use the same inline confirm as deleting a note (the sentence, then a check and an X), not a browser dialog. A signed-in account sees **Write a comment** and **Post** on each habit. On the device's local Sunday those two writes and **Delete comment** are removed and **Writing is paused on Sunday.** stands in their place. **Edit**, **Archive**, and the rating pill stay. **Send Bitcoin** on someone else's comment opens the existing pay sheet. **Continue** stays disabled and shows a spinner while that request is in flight. On Sunday that gift is removed and **Zapping is paused on Sunday.** stands in its place. An amount that is not a whole number of sats from 1 through 10,000,000 shows `Expected a JSON body with an integer "amountSats"` and does not open the invoice. Menu row **Habit-Tracker** (`ListChecks`, `/habit-tracker`) sits immediately after Living room rules.

Handbook states: default, empty, loading, error, signed-in, menu-open, add-weekly, rated-achieved, rated-partial, rated-missed, donate, donate-rate-pending, donate-fiat, donate-invoice, donate-habit-amount, donate-request, donate-request-pending, donate-rate-limit, donate-author-wallet, sunday, editing, archive-confirm, delete-comment, delete-comment-confirm, delete-comment-error, archived, save-error, edit-save-error, archive-confirm-error, add-error, comment-error, add-saved, edit-saved, comment-posted, comment-deleted.

### `/messages`

Fill `AppShell` `align="center"`; `MessagesChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. `MessagesChromeLeft` does not inspect `?c=`: its arrow returns to the previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none. `OnboardingGate screen="welcome"` → `Card xl` `surface={false}` `InboxScreen`: **h1** + inbound list with origin captions on rows. The Direct / Contact / Damus filter is founder/moderator only (`SegmentedControl tone="neutral"`, three pills, one row, not the forum-view dropdown; default Direct; selected `bg-app-btn`). Members see every inbound conversation, no chooser. Staff list is that origin only. Unread inbound rows are semibold with `text-app-fg` last text and, when the derived unread message count is greater than zero, a `text-sm font-semibold tabular-nums lining-nums` digit count right of the name (accessible name `inbox.threadUnread`); read inbound last text muted; last outbound text a filled sent chip. Open thread: counterpart name as heading + origin caption + **Inbox thread bubbles** (incoming full-width muted note card, sent filled `app-btn` right) + composer with ImagePlus attach (`IconButton`, JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 10) and icon send (no filter on the open thread; no in-card back). Typing `@` opens the People list (`thread-mention-suggest`); choosing a person inserts `@username ` (`thread-mention-inserted`) and does not notify them. A stored `@username` in a bubble is the profile button (`thread-mention`). Member empty is `inbox.empty` with no control; staff empty is per-filter catalog copy with the control still visible. Loading / error / open thread hide the control.

### `/messages/[id]` — public note

App shell via `PublicMessageChrome`. Unsigned: `ProfileChromeLeft wordmarkHref="/"` + LanguageSwitcher `tone="light"`. Signed-in: `ProfileChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. Unsigned `PublicMessageLoader` stack: public note card (`Card md`), photo/video `rounded-xl`, a MapPin link when the top-level note has a place (label, or coordinates when the label is null; not on replies), amount `formatBitcoin` as text plus optional preferred-fiat `·` `formatFiatDisplay` of the amount stored when the payment was made (string as-is, a null or missing stored field uses the spot rate; number format from the cookie, otherwise the locale default), no pay, no composer, no copy, no FiatPicker. Signed-in mounts `PublicMessageThread` (`ForumBoard` `composerHidden`, auto-expand): same per-note footer as `/welcome` (React on the root note, copy on the note and on every nested reply, Gift on a payable nested reply, reply composer, staff delete, and **Edit shop note** on a top-level shop note when the viewer is a moderator). Handbook states for that editor: shop-edit, shop-edit-open, shop-edit-place, shop-edit-text, shop-edit-user, shop-edit-summary. Hydrated and signed out: **Log in** (`login.submit`) as `text-app-fg underline underline-offset-2`. There is no second back link under the thread. An external author's name opens `/messages/[id]/author` (the profile card below, not a dialog). While signed in, a member name (`accountId`) on the thread and on a quoted note opens `/members/[accountId]`, and `accountId` wins over `via`. On the unsigned card, and on an unsigned quoted note, a member name stays plain text. Loading / missing / error (`role="alert"` `text-app-danger`) + **Try again**.

### `/messages/[id]/author`

Fill `AppShell` `mode="fill"` `align="center"` via `PublicMessageChrome`. Unsigned: `ProfileChromeLeft wordmarkHref="/"` + LanguageSwitcher `tone="light"`. Signed-in: `ProfileChromeLeft` + `SignedInChrome`. No `OnboardingGate`. Not a member page and not a dialog: no overlay, no portal, no `role="dialog"`, no close control, and no second back. The top-left arrow is the only back control (previous in-app view, or `/welcome` when this tab has none).

Centered column `flex w-full max-w-sm flex-col items-center gap-6` → `Card` `surface={false}` (the member identity card, not a bordered panel). **h1** `profile.title` (**Profile**), `text-center text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight sm:text-3xl`. The heading is Profile, not the person's name. Each section is `flex w-full flex-col items-stretch gap-3 border-t border-app-border pt-6`, overline `text-center text-xs tracking-widest text-app-subtle uppercase`, value `text-center text-sm text-app-fg`. Name always (`name.heading`): truncated name plus an **External** span (`forum.via.nostr`, not a button, no hint paragraph). Until the profile loads, and when the fetch returns null, the name is the trimmed `name` query, or `view.unnamed` when that query is blank. A checked Nostr address (`forum.externalProfileNip05`) only when `nip05` is non-empty. A payment address (`forum.externalProfileLud16`, published text, not a pay control) only when `lud16` is non-empty and differs from `nip05` ignoring case. The Nostr key (`forum.externalProfileNpub`) only when a profile has loaded: `break-all`, not truncated, with a centered `IconButton` `variant="secondary"` `size="md"` (Copy / Check, `aria-label` and `title`, 1200ms). Addresses and the key are not links. No photo, chart, about, message, location, gifts QR, pay button, outbound link, dialog, or close control. Count buttons appear when both `postCount` and `replyCount` are numbers; the feed under the card is read-only (no pay, no composer, no react); a post opens `/messages/{id}`; a reply opens `/messages/{parentId}`; a shorter list shows `profile.activityLatest`; an empty list uses `forum.empty`; loading uses `forum.loading`; failure uses `forum.error` and `view.retry`. A nostr note's **External** control opens `forum.via.nostrHint`. A note in another language offers **Translate**, then the busy control, the translation, **Show original**, and the translate error. If either count is absent, no buttons. Loading and a null fetch show the title, the name, and the External span only. The note id is not validated as a UUID. Profile from `GET /public-messages/:id/external-profile`.

Handbook states: default (signed-out loaded card), signed-in, loading, posts-open, replies-open, posts-loading, replies-loading, posts-error, replies-error, posts-truncated, replies-truncated, copied, posts-empty, replies-empty, posts-external, replies-external, posts-translate, posts-translate-loading, posts-translate-done, posts-translate-hidden, posts-translate-error, replies-translate, replies-translate-loading, replies-translate-done, replies-translate-hidden, replies-translate-error.

### `/view/[viewKey]`

Fill `AppShell` (page frame); `ProfileChromeLeft` with `HomeWordmark` + LanguageSwitcher. `ViewProfileLoader` → identity `Card` `surface={false}` (chart, About me with Languages **Translate** when `aboutMessageId` is set, icon-only copy-profile-link, name, location, the public `username@21.gifts`; no edit/Message; location uses `location.unset` when empty). When a username is set, a centered Open CryptoPay QR (`profile.giftsQr`, center mark `profileQrLogo`) sits under the address, including on a smartphone. A missing username shows no QR. Below: `ViewProfileClaim`.

- Unclaimed: `bg-app-notice` banner + labeled **Activate**.
- Loading: `Loader2` `text-app-subtle`.
- Already claimed: muted sentence + fingerprint `IconButton` primary. After **Log in instead**, the spinner shows while that login runs, and a failed or unknown attempt keeps the claim alert and **Try again**, also over a held-back session; once the login succeeds, `WalletLoginCard` stands in place until the wallet is open, and stays with its alert while that session is held back (no new variant: it is the shared login card).
- Error: alert + `Button` **Try again**.
- In-app: `InAppBrowserView` in a Card.

`referrer: 'no-referrer'` metadata stays (privacy). Do not put the view key in visible chrome.

### `/404`

Marketing shell (duplicated in `not-found.tsx`). `text-5xl font-semibold` “404”, `text-paper/60` body. No second back button. The header arrow is the only back control.

## Voice

Short, warm, direct. People helping people. English examples (catalogs translate). Visitor copy lives in catalog keys (`src/lib/messages.ts`). Four locales: `en`, `de`, `es`, `fil`. No fifth locale.

| Do                                      | Don’t                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Ask for help / Send help                | “Start disrupting philanthropy” / “On-ramp to giving” |
| Direct human-to-human gifts in Bitcoin  | “The needy”, “beneficiaries”, “unbanked”              |

| `₿1'500`                                | “1500 sats” as the visitor-facing string              |

Never on any screen: keys, relays, NOSTR, npub, nsec, zap (except engineers’ handbook, and except the external-author profile page at /messages/[id]/author’s published address and copyable npub), invoice jargon. Push copy stays English `{ title, body }` as the API already sends.

## Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AA.

- **Contrast 1.4.3.** See Color. No orange text on paper. Light subtle `#737373` on white is AA. Dark subtle `#a3a3a3` on ink passes.
- **Target 2.5.8.** Labeled buttons and `IconButton` `md`/`lg` ≥ 44×44 **painted**. In-card `sm` stays 24px paint with `::before` slop (`content-['']` + `-inset-2.5`). Clustered `sm` rows use `gap-5` so 44px hits touch and do not overlap.
- **Non-text 1.4.11.** Focus ring 2px `app-focus`, offset 2px. Do not use orange rings.
- **Reduced motion 2.3.3.** Global CSS in `globals.css`. Keep `scrollIntoView` auto; no theme fade.
- **Focus order:** chrome is the back arrow **then** the wordmark, then switchers or the main title → fields → primary action → Menu. `/welcome` has no arrow, so its chrome starts at the wordmark. Menu open: focus stays on trigger; Escape closes.
- **`aria-label`:** required on every `IconButton`; catalog key, all four locales. Decorative glyphs `aria-hidden`.
- **Color not the only encoding:** profile Given/Received have text labels; forum payable replies are a Gift button plus amount, not color; errors have text; role badges have text + optional hint; push On/Off text plus selected fill, not fill-vs-outline bell.
- **QR:** `role="img"` + catalog label (`QrCode`). QR plates stay white. Member pay sheets show no invoice QR at all; the public pay link omits its invoice QR on a smartphone (`isSmartphoneUserAgent`, not viewport).
- **Expandable notes:** `aria-expanded`. Keyboard Enter/Space.
- **Language listbox:** combobox/listbox.

## Visual regression

Four Playwright combos: `desktop-light`, `desktop-dark`, `mobile-light`, `mobile-dark`. Goldens under `e2e/visual.spec.ts-snapshots/`. Filenames `${visual}-${combo}-linux.png`. `maxDiffPixelRatio` 0. Handbook doc pages are not shot.

A control press that changes what is on screen is its own baseline. The shot before the press does not count as the shot after it. Opened disclosures, menus, confirms, cancels, and expanded rows each need all four combos. An idle or closed shot alone is not that state.

An icon-only status mark is included. Pressing it to reveal or hide the sentence that names it is its own baseline, all four combos, in the same PR. The resting icon shot does not cover that press.

Do not regenerate goldens on a developer machine. Regen is CI / Linux Playwright. `screenshot:check`, `handbook:check`, Function e2e.

Marketing light/dark goldens are identical (always ink) — accepted.

`scripts/check-screenshots.mjs` and handbook images remain the operator-facing proof. Do not add a second screenshot stack.

## Closed decisions

1. **One family: Outfit** (SIL OFL) via `next/font/google`, `weight: 'variable'`, `className={outfit.variable}` on `<html>`. Figtree or Instrument Sans remain an implementer escape hatch only if goldens fail the family test — one grotesque family, not Inter, tabular lining figures still apply.
2. **Two shells remain.** Marketing always-dark, no ThemeSwitcher. App keeps `ThemeProvider` / cookie / `html.dark`. Light theme stays.
3. **Orange is shell-split.** Marketing: primary filled CTA + kickers + stats paint. App: gift-money **fill** only. Never orange text on paper. THE TEST bar is the only decorative orange on `/rules`.
4. **Wordmark is text chrome** `21.gifts`, not an SVG logotype. The only outlined copy is the shop sign inside the printed shop-sticker artwork. Signed-in links to `/welcome` except `/setup/*` (span); marketing, login, donate, and view follow it via `HomeWordmark`.
5. **Control grammar wins.** Labeled for consent/continue/skip/login/logout/retry/activate/sentence-length/marketing primary/donate Open the forum. Icon-only inside cards. Notifications rows are labeled full-row controls. The member identity card has no edit. A moderator can edit a shop note in the posts feed and on a public note.
6. **Pay control is lucide Gift, not ₿, and only on payable replies.** Amount is `formatBitcoin` plus optional `·` `formatFiatDisplay` of the amount stored when the payment was made (string as-is, the current spot rate when that field is missing or null, no ` · —` when that rate is unusable). Accessible name stays **Send Bitcoin** (`forum.pay`). Posts show React (`forum.react`, lucide Reply) and do not show Send Bitcoin.
7. **QR plates stay white** in both themes, `border-app-border`. Member pay sheets show no invoice QR at all; the public pay link omits its invoice QR on a smartphone (`isSmartphoneUserAgent`, not viewport).
8. **Empty profile chart is copy** (`profile.chartEmpty` `role="status"`), not an axis; no SVG / no ₿|fiat scale. Unsigned public view still adds FiatPicker; signed-in empty is copy alone. Failed empty series is `profile.chartError` `role="alert"`, not `profile.chartEmpty`. Null `usd`/`cumulativeUsd` still draws the satoshi chart; USD scale uses an em dash when any raw `cumulativeUsd` is `null`.
9. **Four locales stay** (`en` `de` `es` `fil`). No fifth locale. Brand-voice examples in English.
10. **Markdown in-repo is the source of truth.** Figma is not required.
11. **Three profile pictures, never reused.** Wide image `aspect-[5/2]` and round photo `h-16 w-16` only when stored, above the title. A missing one of those two is the button **Add a wide image** or **Add a profile photo**. The About me photo stays under the bio, shows the whole picture (`object-contain`, `max-h-80`), and is never a cover crop. No initials circle. A portrait chosen for the wide image is framed in the app, not rejected.
12. **No rebrand.** Live marketing is the product face: ink, Outfit, `#f7931a`, wordmark `21.gifts`. Do not kill light theme. Do not regenerate goldens on a developer machine.

**Public-repo hygiene.** In-repo docs never name private repositories, internal hostnames, or infra internals. Say “the API concept document (Brand)” without a private path. CONTRIBUTING already links the public API repo; that link may stay. Mermaid is fine. Keep numbers.
